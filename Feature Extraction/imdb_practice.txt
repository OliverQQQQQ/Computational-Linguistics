420942	2542703	91983	5.0	Something Wild and Fiercely Crazy	The very talented Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith star in this 1986 comedy which takes a sharp turn to drama past the middle of the film . On a lark , a brunette Griffith hijacks Daniels into her car for a weekend of mayhem . There is a visit to her mother and her high school reunion , where she passes off Daniels , ( Charlie ) as her husband . Trouble is that Charlie meets someone from his company there and that guy informs Griffith that Charlie's wife walked out on him as well . On the way to the reunion , Griffith knocks over a store by cleaning out the register . The film gets better when it hits dramatic heights . At the reunion , Griffith meets her ex-husband , played by Ray Liotta . Liotta eventually kicks Charlie out but the latter returns and turns the tables on the ex-con . Is this really worth all of this ? Some pretty fierce fighting ensues and Liotta , the bully , gets it in the chest . A basic story of 2 losers coming together . Fun in some sequences but way too serious by the end .
555623	1406078	231968	8.0	Overcoming prejudice	This nine minutes short film packs more in it than some full length features . Don Weis directed this little gem in which prejudice is dealt with in a subtle manner . A poignant story by Lucille Schlossberg was the basis for the screen play written by Allen Rivkin . It's a simple story . A soldier , whose buddy has died in combat , comes to pay his respects to his mother . Mrs . Wrenley appears to be glad to receive in her home this young man , JoJo , who has brought the last letter he received from the dead soldier . When he mentions his name , Maxie Klein , Mrs . Wrenley clearly changes from the welcoming lady that is happy to meet her son's friend into a woman whose prejudice indicates she resents the intrusion . She can't even understand how his son could have been friendly with the man in front of her . When Maxie offers to read her son's letter , she doesn't refuse . She can't believe what she is hearing as her son talks about tolerance and acceptance he has seen in the army . It's too much for her to digest , but she realizes the goodness in Maxie Klein's heart as her attitude toward him melts away . The film shows excellent performances from Marjorie Main and Keefe Brazelle , the two characters in the short .
485351	1416505	170016	8.0	Never quite understood why it isn't liked any better .	I already loved " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " when it was released and I'm still loving it now , 5 years later . Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out . Sure , the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch . All of the sets , costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way , without ever becoming truly ridicules . It's a visually spectacular movie to watch . It's a campy movie making at its very best ! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie . Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch . He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role . He is of course helped by the convincing make-up , which also received an Academy Award . Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie . This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch . Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor , Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch . The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me . Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here , as in the United States or England . For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest . The musical score by James Horner is good and fun , even though it's your average every day Horner stuff , it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work . Perfect Christmas entertainment .
416461	663392	59798	10.0	Jason Roberts was Outstanding	Always enjoy the great acting of Jason Roberts who was great in the " Ice Man Cometh " and in this film he created a character that is completely against all society with a very deep meaning . Jason plays the role as Murray N . Burns , who has been unemployed for over 6 months who was an entertainer of children on a TV Show and just simply dropped off the show . Murray also raises a young boy named Nick , ( Barry Gordon ) and they both get along very well , however , social services in New York City are concerned about Nick who is a young boy and raised by a man without a job and they send Dr . Sandra , ( Barbara Harris ) to investigate their situation . Dr . Sandra becomes deeply involved with this case and begins to fall madly in love with Murray and the plot begins to become a complete comedy with lots of laughs . Excellent acting by Jason Roberts and Barbara Harris and Barry Gordon gave great supporting roles . Enjoy .
364204	4888011	105428	6.0	now this one was just ridiculous	Sometimes , I wonder why Stephen King allows Hollywood to make certain movies from his books . For instance , " Sleepwalkers " features a scene where a woman stabs a man to death with an ear of corn ! I admit that I haven't read King's novel so I don't know whether or not it included that scene , but was that really supposed to look anything other than completely silly ? ! Not to mention some fairly stupid lines ( Cop kebab ! ) . Other than that , the movie's pretty fun . While some may wonder how a potentially great actress like Alice Krige ended up in something so absurd , I actually found her role quite fascinating ( I consider " Chariots of Fire " a perfidious movie , so I refuse to recognize her role from that one ) . Also starring Cindy Pickett , Lyman Ward and Ron Perlman , plus small appearances by Stephen King , Mark Hamill , Joe Dante , John Landis and Clive Barker .
485187	1416505	339840	4.0	Didn't work for me .	" Undead " had a good and promising beginning . However , as the movie more and more progressed everything began to drag on and the movie even began to irritate me at points . The story seemed to go nowhere and all of the character were way too shallow to make this movie an interesting or good one . The movie is a real gore-fest though . All the gore makes it obvious that this is a Independent-movie that you're watching . To be honest , the gore was the only element of the movie that I really liked and worked out fine . The make-up effects were fantastic . Plain and simple , the movie was too amateur-like at times for me . Obviously the Spierig brothers still have lots of learning to do about film-making . Not everything in the movie always flows and the storytelling is below par at times , probably also due to the poor and simple editing . Also the special effects were far from convincing . Even worse was the horrible musical score . It's the sort of score , a 12-year old come make these days , on his or hers IMac . It was absolutely horrendous at times and it worked extremely irritating . Also the actors were obviously not the most talented in the business . But it were also the characters that they portrayed who were very lacking . Every character in the movie is extremely shallow and the movie lacked a real good main , likable character . The heroic character of the movie looked very much like Torgo from " ' Manos ' : The Hands of Fate " . Not a great look for a hero , even if it was intentional and on top of that the actor that portrayed him did it way too over-the-top . I'm not to sure how to regard this movie . The movie has a totally serious atmosphere and story most of the times but still it has many comedy-elements in it but yet for a comedy it isn't smart and certainly not witty enough . Because of this , the balance between the comedy-horror - and science-fiction elements ended up being extremely flawed . At times you don't know whether to laugh or be terrified . the movie-makers obviously also couldn't make up their mind if they wanted to create a totally serious movie , or a comical one . It all doesn't always make " Undead " a pleasant and easy movie to watch . Nice try , better luck next time .
498586	1355507	90327	6.0	Not a bad effort at all .	Witchboard is set in the LOs Angeles town of Fairfields & starts at a party thrown by Jim Morar ( Todd Allen ) & his girlfriend Linda Brewster ( Twny Kitaen ) , one of their friends Brandon Sinclair ( Stephen Nichols ) decides to demonstrate the use of a Ouija Board ( as you do ) that he has in his back pocket ( as you would ) , he contacts the spirit of a young boy named David . Linda becomes intrigued by the Ouija Board & gives it a go herself the next day while alone , Linda contacts David & he seems pleasant enough despite being dead . However David's helpfulness soon changes & Linda is soon terrorised by the spirit , Linda's guy Jim doesn't fair any better as his best mate is killed & suspicion falls on him . Supernatural expert Brandon realises that an evil spirit is using the inexperienced & weak willed Linda to enter our world . . . This British American co-production was written & directed by Kevin Tenney & one has to say that Witchboard is a fairly slick , competent & enjoyable supernatural horror film that isn't outstanding or original or brilliant but is a perfectly entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes especially if your a fan of the horror genre in general . Everything about Witchboard is a cut above the average low budget horror film , from the surprisingly decent character's & dialogue to a script that tries to do something a bit different with somewhat routine inspiration & as such there's a couple of reasonable twist's at the end although in fairness they don't really affect the story that much but it is nice to have them there all the same just to keep the interest levels going . Of course Witchboard is far from perfect , there's a couple of plot-holes like if the axe murderer needed to possess someone who killed Zarabeth & Brandon ? Also I think Jim needs to choose his friends more carefully , I mean I am not being funny here but anyone who will purposely throw a hatchet towards you witch misses you by inches & then laughs probably isn't worth knowing . . . Witchboard looks surprisingly slick , there's some nice photography including a great shot at the end as the camera follows Jim as he falls through a second storey window right down onto a car roof & there's also one or two other very impressive shots that give Witchboard quite a nice visual style . The one area where Witchboard doesn't quite stand up is in the horror & gore department , over the course of 90 odd minutes there are only three kills in it & apart from a cool shot of an axe going into someones head there's little in the way of blood or gore . The distinctive house used in Witchboard has featured in many films & telly show's including Willard ( 1971 ) & the excellent Waxwork ( 1988 ) . With a supposed budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 this has good production values & looks better than the budget might suggest . The acting is also better than one might expect , Todd Allen appears in the sequel in a completely different role while Kathleen Wilhoite as Zarabeth is equally both annoying & amusing at the same time . Witchboard is a lot better than you might expect & while I would stop short of calling it an absolute classic it's definitely an enjoyable slice of 80's supernatural horror that actually holds up very well . Followed by two less successful sequels Witchboard 2 : The Devil's Doorway ( 1993 ) & Witchboard III : The Possession ( 1995 ) .

The three young men ride bikes , go swimming , and think about having sex . After his widowed father goes off on a pleasure trip with a sexy secretary , Mr . Stern is sent to live with his grandparents , in Buffalo . Meanwhile , Mr . Kelman and Mr . Roberts are sent to summer camp . Stern is lonely , and writes to his friends about traveling across the border to Canada ( at Niagara Falls ) , where claims to be a regular customer at a whorehouse he calls " Rosie's " . Naturally , Kelman and Roberts want a piece of the action , and surprise Stern with a visit . The lads are eager to sample the prostitutes Stern has bragged about - but , of course , the brothel doesn't exist . After seeing the more asexual Canadian sights , the three pick-up beautiful Jacqueline Bisset ( as Anna ) , and take her to their hotel room ? Just ridiculous . Stern , the leading man , is supposed to be playing a young teenager ( he will be returning to high school in the fall ) . He is obviously too old , but has a goofy quality that helps make the movie's " coming-of-age " theme bearable . Stern's plaintive questions to Ms . Bisset about why girls don't like him is nicely played . Bisset has about one and a half sexy scenes ( you'll see a lot more of Niagara Falls ) . So , why would Bisset's English accent be a problem at the Canadian border ? The First Time ( / 69 ) James Neilson - Wes Stern , Jacqueline Bisset , Ricky Kelman
582732	1219578	167404	8.0	I see dead people . . . .	Here comes Bruce Willis again in the skin of a rescuer ! But unlike " the fifth element " and " armageddon " , he mustn't save the whole wide world . Neither , must he save a group of persons from a terrorist threat as it was the case with " die hard . No , he simply must save a little boy called Cole , haunted by morbid visions and Willis , a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him . . . With " fight club " and " the blair witch project " , " the sixth sense " ranks among the best movies made in 1999 . It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it . If you're watching this movie for the first time , you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however , they are important for the development of the story . The same thing can also be said for a few scenes , especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him . . . Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay . Rarely , a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay . It's disconcerting , disturbing and however perfectly coherent . For a long part , the movie is a beautiful " trompe l'oeil " . On another hand , it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man . In " the sixth sense " , it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director . But he isn't the main center of the movie . This place goes to Haley Joel Osment . His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary . Besides , he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny , the little boy in Kubrick's " shining " because they've got a common point : an odd power supernatural and all in all , the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like : they're simply asking him for help . . . At the end , a fascinating movie held up by two great actors .
406529	2020269	113043	3.0	Disney's " Pinocchio " was scarier ?	Nice try ? but that's about the only positive thing you can say about this lackluster attempt to blend psychological thriller with eerie horror monsters . The script desperately tries to be intelligent and innovating but the result is a very poor and tedious movie , even for the already low 90's standards . The story handles about an overly ambitious psychology student who motivates a clique of people to go on a mountain-weekend where he'll finish his thesis about phobias . The point is that all the participants get over their fears by talking about them and , in the meantime , our college boy can process his own childhood trauma . Upon arrival , everyone's fear comes to life in the shape of a life-size wooden dummy . Of course the puppet means trouble ! It's made by Indians ? it's always the Indians with their spiritual evils , I tell you ! ! This movie takes itself way too seriously and the makers actually seem to believe that the subject matter is deep and complex ! It's not ! It's more than obvious that every character hides one of several dark secrets and the viewer figures them all out long before they reveal the " truth " themselves . I've rarely seen a movie so predictable than " The Fear " . The story gets more and more annoying near the end and , the more clever it tries to be , the more ridiculous it all looks . The wooden " evil personified " dummy isn't very impressive and the squeaky stretching-sounds he constantly makes aren't my idea of eerie sound effects . Pinocchio actually was a lot scarier ? at least he could do tricks with his nose . The acting performances are forgettable , even though I'm sure the guy who came up with the idea to offer Wes Craven a small role is very proud of himself . In case you're looking for some really unsettling evil-dummy horror movies , check out " Pin " ( brilliant but disgracefully underrated 80's thriller ) and " Magic " ( staring a young Anthony Hopkins " .
400880	7743887	72289	10.0	Wilder & Newhart - What A Great Team !	Sometime in the early ' 80's , an industrial dispute resulted in the last-minute cancellation of my favourite show ' Minder ' . In its place I . T . V . screened a U . S . T . V . movie I had not seen before : ' Thursday's Game ' . I watched mainly because it starred Gene Wilder and the equally wonderful Bob Newhart ( if you have never heard his comic monologues , you owe it to yourself to do so ) . Wilder is ' Harry Evers ' , producer of a daytime game show called ' Let's Chance It ! ' . The ratings are dropping so , expecting cancellation , he goes to see an employment officer ( Nancy Walker ) with a view to putting himself back on the job market . Initially , she tells him that getting a new job will be easy . She then finds out she has read the wrong resume . Reading the correct one , she does not look happy . Harry's worst fears are confirmed . He is unemployable . The highlight of Harry's week is his Thursday night poker game with his buddies , among them Marvin ( Newhart ) , owner of a successful fashion empire . One night , the game erupts into a fight when a losing player refuses to pay Harry what he owes him . Determined to keep the tradition of the wife-free Thursday night alive , he and Marvin begin going to theatres , cinemas , and bars . Marvin is also going through a mid-life crisis - he wants to divorce his much older wife Lois ( Cloris Leachman ) but is afraid to do so in case she tries to top herself . Harry approaches Ann ( Valerie Harper ) with a view to an affair , but cannot bring himself to go through with it . Then disaster strikes - his wife Lynne ( Ellen Burstyn ) finds out the game ended months ago , and thinks her husband is cheating on her . . . This was made in 1971 but went unscreened until 1974 , possibly to cash in on Wilder's popularity in the Mel Brooks movies , as well as Burstyn's role in ' The Exorcist ' . The studio executives who did not like it must have been watching with their eyes shut . ' Thursday's Game ' is a warm , funny comedy which encompasses adult themes such as marriage , divorce , redundancy , depression , adultery , and above all friendship . Unusually for a comedy of this kind , James L . Brooks ' script is not shot through with unrealistic one-liners , the humour arises naturally out of the characters and situations . Wilder is fabulous , only going over the top when he has to . When Harry is fired , he sits there stone-faced listening to the squeak of his chair before casually trashing his ex-boss ' office . Newhart's big moment comes when Marvin tells Lois he wants a divorce over dinner in a busy New York restaurant , and she suffers a bout of hysteria , predating the most famous scene in ' When Harry Met Sally ' by almost two decades . The chemistry between the stars is wonderful . Funniest moment ? Its when Harry goes to see his agent ( Rob Reiner ) and is stunned to find the man does not know who he is , despite him having been paid ten per cent of Harry's salary each month for four years . Harry's rage is hysterical to watch . At the end , Marvin , now a free man , goes off to Europe , and you find yourself almost wishing Harry would go with him . But Harry's loyalty to his family is too strong . ' Thursday's Game ' is hard to track down , but for fans of Wilder and Newhart or anyone just wanting a good laugh it is well worth the effort .
407067	865972	95285	6.0	Mildly interesting vampire flick from the director of " Midnight " .	" Heartstopper " was directed by John A . Russo and is based on his own written novel " The Awakening " . The plot is simple : a young doctor named Benjamin Latham condemned and put to death as a warlock in 1776 , is back from the dead in present day Pittsburgh as a fangless vampire who's saliva is a deadly poison and who can walk only during the daylight hours . He meets up with museum curator Moon Zappa , falls in love with her and comes across a copycat serial killer who also seems to have the same vampiric affliction and dispatches women in a style similar to Latham's . The premise of " Heartstopper " is actually pretty unique and original , but the film is surprisingly dull and uninteresting . The cinematography is grainy , the acting is decent and the heavy metal soundtrack adds a raw edge to the urban atmosphere . Give it a look , but " Midnight " is a much better film . .
399510	1391795	107254	8.0	Here I Go Again ; I'm Obviously MUCH Too Easy To Please !	Interesting " Friday the 13th " entry has nothing connecting it to the last entry ( " Jason Takes Manhattan " ) . Instead , the opening has Jason pursuing a nubile young woman through the woods ; she turns out to be an FBI agent who lures Jason right into a trap - and his body is blown to smithereens in the ensuing ambush . HOWEVER ( of course , there has to be a " however " ) , this still doesn't mean that Jason is dead - the evil force that has animated Jason all these years is still very much alive and free to inhabit a succession of victims . This ninth " Friday the 13th " movie has some interesting story twists that were only then , after eight previous movies , being concocted . This is an energetic , emphatically violent , lively ( and very mean-spirited , unfortunately ) horror sequel with spectacular gore ( particularly in the unrated director's cut ) and performances that are actually something approaching decent . An entertaining way to spend an hour and a half . There are a few visual in-jokes that horror fans will instantly recognize . In addition to playing Jason , stuntman Kane Hodder also appears sans makeup as one of two FBI agents ( he's the big , bearded one ) guarding the morgue . Even if you don't enjoy it , you may want to stick around for the surprise in the very last scene . It will either make you groan or clap , depending on your disposition towards these kinds of movies .
516754	1132073	268695	10.0	Great film ! Below is My thoughts !	I just watch the Time Machine for only the second time but I appreciated the film much more than I did before ! The effects is very good , the acting is good , the sets look very realistic , and the story is fantastic ! Guy Pearce was good and I thought Orlando Jones was good . The music is extraordinary . The truth is I cried when this wonderful part was at the end credits . It starts when the credits say about Stan Winston Studios . It was of course in the film when Guy Pearce lost his necklace in the Time Machine . Also it is located on the original score track number six " I don't belong here " . It is really an emotional piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer's colleague Klaus Badelt ! I really liked this short but epic picture . Great for time traveling movie fans ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : The following is in My opinions and My thoughts . This movie has an important message I believe . To make it short a person should appreciate life even if it isn't a perfect world . A person should look up at the sky and look at the moon and think how beautiful it looks and what ever time it is whether the sky is a twilight , a cloudy , or what ever kind of sky and thank the lord that he / she can look at it . Us people should be very thankful that we have all of the great trees and animals to live together in the same world . The person should make life better for a better future just not for the person but for everyone around the person . We don't know how the future will be in several years or decades or even further . We should start and use ours minds and stop being cocky and thinking we know everything when we really haven't even begun to learn . Think about , We don't know what God and his heaven looks like . Heck , we don't even know all of the species of fish and other life forms in the ocean . Sure we humans have existed for thousands of years but how long have we had our great technology of today such as televisions . video games , and of course electricity . This hasn't been around long at all compared to how long our human race has . We should all appreciate everything and think before we leap . I just think of things that are important and that most that don't care . This is My thoughts ! Thank you for reading !
450751	2093818	315327	7.0	OK Jim Carrey comedy	Jim Carrey hasn't been in a comedy for a couple of years ; in fact , he hasn't done anything but some not-too-good dramas , so naturally , his fans were expecting a lot from the film that would mark his " return " to comedy . I believe that a lot of people , especially Christians , are offended by this , because of the somewhat comic portrayal of God , among other things . I didn't find said things offensive , though I can understand how some might find them offending . However , if we forget about the immediate offense some will take from the very theme of this film , and look further , we'll find an okay attempt at explaining faith and God , without simplifying or mocking . Yes , the attempt is hidden behind a lot of ( so-so ) comedy , but if you look closer , there are a lot of references to Christianity and perhaps even a few metaphors . It's not a particularly funny or effective comedy , in spite of director Tom Shadyac's track record with working with Carrey , but it's not awful . The jokes are found more in special effects , and situations we accept because of the power harnessed ( and given that , one might have expected more interesting things to happen ) by the title character . . . rather than Carrey's performance , the dialog or other material . I'd recommend this to any fan of Jim Carrey . Just don't expect it to be as funny as his best work ( I maintain that Steve Oedekerk is unfunny and ought to stay away from Jim ) .
544330	562732	1139668	3.0	The Exorcism of Casey Beldon . . .	January is not such a good time for movies . The holiday season is over people are getting back to work and school and their normal lives , and the movie studios seem to take this opportunity to unload all their half-witted movies that probably no one is going to be interested in anyway . It seems that way every time I see a movie like The Unborn , anyway . This thing is so thin and weak it's like a cinematic version of weak tea , and weak tea is not something you want your audience to be thinking about while they're suffering through your scary movie . Brought to us by the director of Blade : Trinity ( and pretty much nothing else ) , The Unborn is the story of a girl who had a twin that died in utero because her umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck in the womb and strangled him , and she didn't become aware of it until decades later when his evil spirit decided that he was ready to be born now . Sadly , the movie relies almost entirely on endless shots of creepy kids with deadpan expressions and , occasionally , colored contact lenses . But don't go thinking the clichés stop there , the movie is so jam-packed with cheap horror techniques that it almost feels like an educational experience in everything to avoid doing in making a scary movie . The extreme close-up of the mutated babyface and the sudden screeching noise when the eyes flip open used to be a pretty scary effect . I can't remember when that was , it's been a number of decades now , but there was a time in the distant past when that shot had a cool effect . Now it's been so overdone and copied that it's no loner anything more than a big red flag that the movie you're watching is wasting your time ! In the movie's defense , it has a clear ability to create a tense atmosphere . Much of it is beautifully photographed , and the combination of the slow tracking shots and the moody music give a feeling of unease which , in a better movie , could easily pave the way for a genuinely freaky horror show . But unfortunately , every bit of the rest of the movie is as wispy and uninteresting as a pair of old underwear . Odette Yustman stars as the afflicted Casey Beldon , faced with a terrible situation in which she is slowly losing her soul to an invading demon , back for revenge for that one pesky sibling rivalry that they had before they were born . Poor Casey finds out at the most vulnerable time that she inadvertently killed her own brother , which has to have some kind of devastating effect on a person , even one who is not in such an , ah , emotional state as Casey is in . Oh , and speaking of emotional states , there is a point where Casey is absolutely certain that she is being pursued by an evil spirit , and even when the bizarre things that have been happening to her seem to leave no room for any other explanation , her lunkhead boyfriend says this to her ? " I don't think you're crazy , I just think you're hormonal . " A word of advice , gentlemen ? I don't claim to be any kind of all-knowing expert about the wonders and mysteries of the fairer sex , but I tend to have a natural feeling that if your girlfriend is upset about something , the suggestion that it's " that time of the month " is generally a pretty efficient way to make yourself single . Or bruised and swollen somewhere . And if she's upset because she's being pursued by demons , she may just cut to the chase and kill you . Besides , it's clear that Casey needs a lot of help , because not only does she make all of those breathtakingly stupid decisions that horror movie cannon-fodder generally make , but she also begins to appear more and more crazy to the people around her as she begins to believe more and more that this demonic possession thing is happening to her for real . Of course , making her look crazy is neither surprising nor interesting . It's an ancient horror movie technique intended to make the supernatural element seem more real by giving us someone to relate to ? the people who are looking at this girl like she's a total lunatic . Unfortunately , when the character is so undeveloped and uninteresting that it's impossible to care about her , this crazy element does nothing for the suspense . Except maybe reverse it . There are certainly some interesting visuals in the movie , even some of the clichés ( a good many of them involving the old bathroom mirror scare ) are older than the hills but at least look pretty cool . The spider-walk is lifted directly out of The Exorcist ( and it's such an obvious plagiarism that I'm going to go ahead and chalk it up to an homage ) , and there are some pretty clever manifestations of the demon , but the movie is so slow and plodding and full of half-assed performances ( even the great Gary Oldman is totally dismissable here ) that it feels like even the movie is sleeping through itself . And it doesn't help matters that the climax of the film is an exorcism that consists of a lot of strobe lights and big fans in a low-rent studio . Believe it or not , I didn't hate the movie , but I'm a long-time horror fan and I have a tendency to enjoy horror movies that most other people would punch me for suggesting . But whether or not you enjoy the lower half of the horror genre , it's definitely true that there are quite a few much better movies about demonic possession that would be a far better use of your time than The Unborn . Personally , I suggest The Exorcism of Emily Rose , which is one of the best I've seen ?

Well , as part of his fraternity initiation , Lewis has to sneak into a mausoleum to retrieve the ring from the cadaver the young med students had earlier seen autopsied . Of course Lewis has to do this at night ? in the dark ? of which he's deathly afraid . You get the idea . Ring of Terror is the kind of movie that could have better been told as something like a Twilight Zone episode . There's nowhere near enough material to fill even the comparatively short 71 minute runtime . But the makers of the movie seem content to pad the film with something akin to one of those 1950s era educational films on dating with names like " Dating : Do's and Don'ts " or " Choosing Your Marriage Partner " . Ring of Terror has that kind of " realism " and " excitement " . Getting past the padding to the rest of Ring of Terror : the acting is bad ; the actors are far too old to be convincing in their roles ; the movie relies on too many " fat " jokes ; the ending is predictable after 5 minutes of the movie ; and the opening and closing bits that sandwich the " action " are annoying . In short , it's a disaster . But as bad a movie as Ring of Terror is , it makes for a very entertaining episode of MST3K . I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion . So while I may only rate the movie a , Ring of Terror gets a on my MST3K rating scale .
382047	449021	132164	3.0	And life goes on .	This is a ' round robin ' of several different stories and groups of characters that intersect each other . This makes for a tough time to follow and get into . The abundant strong language makes for reality , but may offend some viewers . Strong point is very good writing . Stick with this one . There is a diverse gathering of talent featuring : Luke Perry , Tom Sizemore , Virginia Madsen , Chris Penn , Mary Stuart Masterson , Michael Madsen , Burt Young , Hal Holbrook and James Beulushi . On a lazy weekend , a good companion movie would be DINER .
407573	865972	95140	1.0	Another horribly bad slasher flick .	I've seen plenty of stupid and utterly worthless slasher flicks , but " Fatal Pulse " manages to be the worst of them all ( still I need to see " Blood Lake " and " The Last Slumber Party " ) . It's extremely routine and offers zero surprises . The plot is simple : a black-gloved killer is knocking off sorority sisters . . . The acting is awful , the gore is non-existent and the killings are lame ( the victims are strangled , electrocuted , etc . ) However one killing totally cracked me up : unlucky sorority girl has her throat slashed with a record . There is also plenty of nudity to satisfy some teenagers . Avoid this crap like the plague . . Give it a look only if you are a masochist or a rabid collector of low-budget slasher movies .
453789	11228318	60503	10.0	John and Faith Hubley's Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature was a pretty humorously entertaining Oscar-winning animated short	Just watched this Oscar-winning John and Faith Hubley-written and produced animated short distributed by Paramount on YouTube as linked from Cartoon Brew . The title's meaning is that two Herb Albert selections - " Spanish Flea " and " Tijuana Taxi " - are illustrated in animated form in their entirety . " Spanish Flea " has the title character annoying a donkey , chicken , a gangster and his girlfriend and other people at a hotel party . " Tijuana Taxi " has the driver trying to get his passengers to the plane on time . Both segments have compellingly humorous abstract line drawings set to the beat of the wonderful music . Don't want to say anymore except I highly recommend Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature .
518370	8239592	48696	8.0	A hugely enjoyable 50's giant monster on the loose sci-fi / horror romp	Kindly scientist Leo G . Carroll creates a remarkable special nutrient which makes animals grow to alarmingly large sizes at an accelerated rate . A giant spider escapes from Carroll's lab and goes on the rampage . It's up to Carroll , affable country doctor John Agar and spunky , fetching lab assistant Mara Corday to figure out a way to stop the over-sized killer arachnid before things get too out of hand . Capably directed by 50's sci-fi / horror master Jack Arnold , with a bright , witty script by Robert M . Fresco and Martin Berkley , a steady pace , a booming , ominous score by Henry Mancini , lively and engaging performances from a solid and charming cast ( Nestor Paiva is especially strong as the cranky no-nonsense sheriff while a then unknown Clint Eastwood has a nice cameo towards the end as a jet fighter pilot ) , nifty special effects , sharp , moody photography by George Robinson , a splendidly spooky atmosphere ( the strikingly stark panoramic shots of the bleak , arid , desolate desert landscape have a wonderfully eerie feel to them ) , fine make-up by Bud Westmore , and several rousing sequences with the titanic tarantula wreaking havoc , this vintage 50's creature feature kick overall rates as a great deal of straightforward and unpretentious monster movie fun .

( No sub-titles-I promise ! )	There probably isn't much I can say that others haven't said already and at some length , I suspect , so I'll say this : what Rocky Horror Picture Show is to a great many people , this film is to me . I know most of the dialogue , the songs the minstrels sing , the timing and so on . I have probably seen this film more than any other and it never gets old for me . Sheer antic lunacy on a par with The Marx Brothers and glorious fn all round ( I feel happy , I feel happy ! < Whap ! > Most stupendously , wonderfully , delightfully recommended .

407101	865972	62231	6.0	Trashy Argentinian vampire flick with plenty of nudity .	A group of obnoxious swingers are touring the vamp's area when their hippie van collapses , leaving them to spend an unforgettable and seemingly unlivable evening at the Count's lodge . The Count has kept an unwilling yet equally undead bride in his clutches and the blood begins to flow . . . I kind of enjoyed this trashy little flick , however there are some incredibly dull and boring spots . The acting is very bad , the atmosphere is non-existent , but if you are a fan of exploitation flicks , who enjoys watching bare breasts of some fine looking Argentinian ladies you may want to give this blood-sucker a try . Cinematically we're treated to numerous topless Go-Go dancers who wiggle wildly to cool-school jazz while inserts of sea gulls double for vampire bats . Vieyra's genre credits include : " The Deadly Organ " , the mind-blowing " Curious Dr . Humpp " and of course " Blood of the Virgins " . My generous rating : .
405243	2020269	165963	6.0	Belgo-exploitation !	Quite a difficult movie to come across , this " State of Mind " , but it sure looks like a worthy purchase in case you're an avid cult-collector ? at least , on the surface it looks like that . The DVD-cover proudly lists the names of famous horror stars like Fred Williamson , Jill Shoelen and ? above all ? Paul Naschy and the film is produced by James Desert , known for unleashing the notorious " Lucker ? the Necrophagous " upon the world . The famous names are merely just touts ( especially Paul Naschy's appearance is incredibly brief ) and the story isn't nearly as shocking as that of " Lucker " . Still , this movie isn't a total waste of time and , if you don't expect much , you might even find it enjoyable . The plot makes absolutely no sense and contains more holes than a teabag but , at the same time , it's delightfully deranged and awry , and thus very appealing to sick puppies as myself . The story is typically set in James Desert-world ? This means there are no normal people at all . Everyone is either an eccentric loner with a dark past ? or a homicidal maniac on the loose . " State of Mind " combines both as an escaped female serial killer finds shelter at the mansion of an insane single woman . Two serpents on one film-set ? satisfaction guaranteed ! Handsome police duo Loomis & Wishman ( Fred Williamson and Jill Shoelen ) don't have a clue since they assume that the serial killer died in a car accident . I counted a handful of really atmospheric sequences and there's a lot of sickening gore . Like we expect from James Desert , the violence is very graphic and thus definitely not for the squeamish among us . Of course , if you want to enjoy this film , you have to look past the terrible acting performances and the imbecile dialogues . Perhaps it's mainly because I'm Belgian myself ( like James Desert is ) but I'm glad to have this movie in my collection . The absurd plot , the violence and the cheap production values make it feel like an old-fashioned exploitation film and I applaud that .
573167	4248714	114388	5.0	Sense and Sensibility	Based on the popular book by Jane Austen , with the Oscar winning screenplay by Emma Thompson , and directed by BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ang Lee ( Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ; Brokeback Mountain ) made it sound pretty good . It is a good film , but to be honest , I only wanted to see it for the amount of good British actors and actresses appearing in it . It is mainly a story of class or something with some marriages , a death , and obviously a load of the best of British talents ever . Starring BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated ( for actress ) Emma Thompson as Elinor Dashwood , the gorgeous BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet as Marianne Dashwood , BAFTA nominated Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon , Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars , Greg Wise as John Willoughby , Bridget Jones ' Gemma Jones as Mrs . Dashwood , Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele , BAFTA nominated Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs . Jennings , Tom Wilkinson as Mr . Dashwood , The Vicar of Dibley's James Fleet as John Dashwood , Imelda Staunton as Charlotte Palmer , Hugh Laurie as Mr . Palmer and Sugar Rush's Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars . I couldn't exactly understand the entire story , in fact , I don't think I finished the film . But what I do remember and understand was pretty good . It was nominated for Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Music for Patrick Doyle and Best Picture , it won the BAFTA for Best Film , and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Make Up / Hair , Best Production Design , Best Adapted Screenplay , the David Lean Award for Direction , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay , and it was nominated for Best Original Score . It was number 70 on 100 Years , 100 Passions . Worth watching !
469279	1532177	285742	6.0	Summed Up By Berry's Acceptance Speech	It's a well known fact that MONSTER'S BALL won Halle Berry an Oscar for best actress and led to one of the most bizarre sites in the history of the ceremony where Berry shrieked , wept and gnashed her teeth in an uncontrollable manner . She probably wasn't overcome with emotion - She was impersonating the average person's reaction to seeing this film ! Depressing doesn't even begin to sum up this movie . It starts with the domestic life of three generations of prison officers the Grotowski family , two of which give racist redneck scumbags a bad name . A black prisoner is about to be executed and the middle and younger Grotowski ( Hank and Sonny respectively ) are looking after him and these scenes are amongst the most feel good moments of the story ! Words fail to describe what a bleak depressing movie this is . It's about redemption and finding love in the worst of circumstances but it's never entirely convincing . The fate of Sonny Grotowski didn't ring true and in the case of Berry's character just how unlucky can someone be in such a short period of time ? I will congratulate the performances of the cast in this very well acted movie . Billy Bob Thornton is probably best remembered as " one of the men who married Angelina Jolie " but is also one of America's underappricated actors ( His screen writing abilities are also overlooked ) who manages to rise above the sometimes inconsistent material while Halle Berry what can I say ? Apart from that she really did deserve the Oscar . Well regarded character actor and acting guru Peter Boyle might be disappointing as Hank's reactionary father but since his character spends most of his time sitting in a chair slowly dying from respiratory failure he's not given much to do But it should be pointed out once again that this is a very sad and melancholy film that won't have anyone dancing in the aisles I did appreciate the good performances but I doubt I'll be watching it again in a hurry
429052	3079504	56405	7.0	Bad Movie Monster Classic	This is the story of what happens when a part of a long dead monster is dug up and allowed to grow to Godzilla proportions before it destroys much of Copenhagen . This film exists in two versions the American release version and the version that was released Europe . The films while telling essentially the same story are cut very differently . The European version runs over 10 minutes longer , which doesn't include alternate versions of scenes . Most tellingly missing from the American version is a pointless song by the handyman to a bunch of kids in a park , beach romance scenes between two of the characters and the the legendary flying scenes , which consist of the monster model being flown on strings at night ( their removal was probably a good idea ) . The American version also is missing the spitting of the animated green goo . I just finished watching the two versions of the film back to back and find that the non-English version is a better film , there are more shots of the monster and of destruction , and even though some look worse , its some how a more sincere , more complete film ( Handyman song aside ) . No its not a good film by any stretch of the imagination but it is a fun film , with a monster the likes of which we don't see any more . Its one of the dumbest , yet coolest , monsters in movie history . Yea its a badly animated puppet in fake settings , but its till a great way to enjoy a rainy Saturday afternoon . ( Just skip to the monster parts )
401014	7743887	145614	10.0	Journey To Michael's Mad World !	Bowler hatted men march over Westminster Bridge . Lining up firing squad fashion , they aim their umbrellas at the Union flag and shoot . It could be the opening to an ' Avengers ' caper , instead it was the prelude to one of the zaniest comedies the B . B . C . has ever made - ' Its A Square World ' . I have only seen one episode of this fondly remembered ' 60's show ( repeated in 1976 as part of a B . B . C . retrospective ) but enjoyed it enormously . The late Michael Bentine not only starred ( his ' lecture ' sketches predated those of Ronnie Barker on ' The Two Ronnies ) , but co-wrote it with John Law . As you'd expect from one of the founders of ' The Goon Show ' , the show was rich in inspired lunacy , employing animation , puppets and Visual Effects , in sketches such as ' What Goes On In A Singer's Mind ' ( little animated men running around inside a man's head ) , a B . B . C . reporter interviewing a sexy French film-star loses his composure and tries to kiss her , a Chinese junk sails up the Thames and fires at The Houses Of Parliament , the source of the Thames turns out to be a giant dripping tap , a spy disclosing stolen rocket secrets over a public phone is astonished when the box takes off like a rocket , the B . B . C . T . V . centre is attacked by cowboys and Indians and , in a later episode , is shot into space . Many believe this to have been a major influence on later flights of fancy such as ' Monty Python's Flying Circus ' and ' The Goodies ' . Anything could happen in ' Its A Square World ' and usually did . The supporting cast included ( though not all at the same time ) Clive Dunn , Ronnie Barker , Deryck Guyler , Frank Thornton and Dick Emery . Bentine later took the show to A . T . V . - resulting in the less successful ' All Square ' . After a spell on children's television , in 1977 , he tried to revive the show . A pilot entitled ' Michael Bentine's Square World ' was screened , but led to no series . Which was a pity , seeing how it was directed by the brilliant Jim Franklin . Two sketches stick out ; office workers doing acrobatics in the workplace , leaping over desks and so on and a superb World War Two sketch about witches and warlocks forming their own air force . The sight of women in pointed hats on broomsticks taking off from an airfield ' 633 Squadron'-style had to be seen to be believed ! With more and more archive television appearing on D . V . D . , given the talent involved in its making and its importance in the development of British comedy , is it too much to ask that ' Its A Square World ' be considered for release in the not-too distant future ?
408999	2567136	52561	6.0	One Angry Manion	This is yet another Hollywood entry that made a lot of noise in its day but now seems dated . It top-bills Jimmy Stewart as a small-town lawyer in North Michigan who is asked to defend serviceman Ben Gazzara on a murder rap . Seems Gazzara's wife , Lee Remick , got herself raped by one Barney Quill following which Gazzara went looking for Quill with his service revolver and put a bullet where it would do the most good . Neither of these three principals is exactly chopped liver and there is strong support - by Eve Arden especially - in the shape of George C . Scott , Murray Hamilton , Arthur O'Connell and John Qualen . Duke Ellington provided the score though we don't get enough of it and courtroom dramas really should be more dramatic , although , of course , maybe at the time it was .
400713	7743887	96666	4.0	Straight Down The Middle !	One of Johnny Speight's lesser creations , ' The Nineteenth Hole ' was set in a posh golf club where chauvinism and bigotry are rife among the well-heeled members . Speight was a golf lover and knew what went on in these places . Eric Sykes , kitted out in flat cap and long johns , played the club's harassed secretary , and was chiefly responsible for what few laughs there were . Like Speight's earlier ' Spooner's Patch ' , the main problem was that , with the exception of the Secretary , almost every character was a carbon-copy of Alf Garnett . There was no-one to provide a counterbalance to the non-stop parade of prejudiced and ill-informed tirades . The end result was tiresome rather than funny , akin to watching the B . B . C . ' s ' Question Time ' . The show squandered the talents of such fine actors as Garfield Morgan , John Quayle , Derek Newark , Norman Rossington ( essentially reprising his ' Spooner's Patch ' role ) , and Brian Glover . In one episode , a club member ( played by Ken Campbell ) named Mr . Johnson underwent a sex change operation and the committee debated whether or not to permit her to use the men's bar . When it was finally agreed she be allowed to use it , other members underwent the same operation and crowded the bar . One I . T . V . station ( T . S . W . ) was so embarrassed by the show they cancelled it in mid-run . Apart from some U . K . Gold repeats in the late ' 90's , it has not been seen anywhere since . The idea probably looked good on paper , but even the normally brilliant Speight could not get out of this particular hole .
555489	1406078	205873	7.0	Houston , we have a problem	Parkes , New South Wales , Australia , became famous for its gigantic satellite dish in the middle of a sheep paddock . This dish was instrumental for communicating with the men of Apollo 11's mission to the moon . Neil Armstrong and his colleagues are about to land on the moon and suddenly the Australian tracking station loses contact with them . How could the people of the world react if they can't see the men taking steps on the lunar surface ? It's something that the technicians in Australia will have to deal with to relay the images of man's first walk on the moon . " The Dish " , directed with folksy charm by Rob Sitch , shows how the people in Parkes , a remote spot , a simple dot in the map , rally for the biggest event in their lives . They are proud of being at the center of such a historical moment . At the same time we are taken behind the scenes to see what is really going on . Cliff Buxton , and his team are dealt a blow when they lose the signal to Apollo 11 . Instead of panicking , Buxton decides not to tell Houston about the problem they are experiencing . Luckily , everything turns out all right . Sam Neill , makes an impression as Cliff Buxton . Patrick Warburton is equally good playing the NASA representative , Al Burnett . The Australian cast is wonderful in the way they capture the small time atmosphere in their moment where they are at the center of the world's attention . " The Dish " is an enjoyable comedy .
435756	9938570	451984	8.0	Criminal Woman : Killing Melody	This time Miki Sugimoto is the star and Reiko Ike takes the secondary lead female role . Sugimoto stars as Massayo , the daughter of a murdered alcholic / addict by powerful Yakuza boss , Obi ( ôji Hayama ) , sent to prison when she attempts to kill him in a club . Ike is Maki , Obi's squeeze , in prison she meets Massayo and they become respected " adversaries . " Massayo befriends other inmates and they partner up after serving their time , vowing to take down Obi's organization by causing a Yakuza war between him and another inferior gang , the Hamayasu clan who operate the docking port of the city . Massayo prostitutes herself to Americans exchanging sexual favors for artillery , concocting a weapons trade with old man boss Hamayasu's volatile son , Tetsu ( Takeo Chii ) . Maki is back around Obi's arm and warns Massayo of clearing out of town , or else . The rest of the film shows how Massayo and her clever female clan rip apart the two Yakuza gangs by pitting them against each other , while also shedding some blood themselves in the process . And , you can better believe Maki and Massayo will have one more confrontational showdown when so much money and dope are at stake . Fans of pinku revenge crime flicks get their moneys's worth with CRIMINAL WOMAN : KILLING MELODY . As expected nudity and ultra-violence are in abundance with lots of gunfire and Yakuza gangsters blown to smithereens . It's always entertaining seeing a motley group of gorgeous females waging war with the Yakuza , using their brains and looks to gain an advantage . You get a rather mild torture sequence this time around as Massayo is rescued from a rather grim fate by Maki . Chii's bonkers Tetsu ( . . always with a large bottle of liquor , downing it before shooting at somebody or raising hell against Obi ) is hilarious as are the instances where animated Yakuza gangsters are either lifted in the air by dynamite / grenades or shot to pieces by bullet-fire . We get not one but TWO hand-to-hand combats between Sugimoto and Ike ( . . the first in prison , testing each other's endurance , is a dandy ) which it in itself is added incentive for pinku fans to check this flick out . Plenty of bare flesh between Ike and Sugimoto as well . It was nice seeing Sugimoto this time getting to star as the lady of vengeance and when she stares you down with death in her eyes . . LOOK OUT ! Nothing more dangerous than Sugimoto scorned ! Ike may not have the lucrative role here , but she's still looking mighty fine . As expected , the pace is excellent ( . . the editing and camera work are first-rate ) and action set pieces thrilling . And , as you'd expect , nearly everyone is dead by the end of the film .
409490	2567136	49406	7.0	They Shoot Horses , Don't They	Kubrick made this film before being stricken by what I call David Leanitis , a disease with no known cure in which directors who have done sterling work and enjoyed great success with ' small ' films become susceptible to an overwhelming urge to do ' epic ' witness Lean himself who made a brilliant and acknowledged all-time classic set largely in the confines of a railway station which served as a microcosm for the world at large but couldn't rest until he'd explored the vastness of 1 ) the desert , 2 ) Mother Russia and 3 ) the sub-Continent . If anything Kubrick went one better seeing Lean's desert and raising him outer Space . However The Killing stands up reasonably well after half a century albeit Kubrick more or less ' stole ' the plot of John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle which was then some six years old . For movie buffs the cast is a dream from top-billed Sterling Hayden more or less replicating his role in The Asphalt Jungle with the minor difference that this time around he was the master-mind ( a role played by Sam Jaffe in ' Jungle ' ) instead of just one of the team , through Joe Sawyer , Jay C . Flippen , Elisha Cook , Jay Adler , Timothy Carey with a special mention for Marie Windsor as the femme fatale to end them all . It was made at the tail-end of the ' crime-does-not-pay ' era or , more accurately , crime must not be SEEN to pay which means that there is a fairly risible ending in which Hayden , stuck with two million dollars in small bills buys a suitcase without bothering to check if it locks or even attempting to secure it with straps , etc , so that it can fall off the trolley taking it to the plane and burst open . Prior to that the planning and execution of the heist , shot out of context and beefed up by voice-over narration , had held the interest whilst being far inferior to Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge , which remains if not the last then certainly Next to the last word in heist movies . Certainly worth checking out of Blockbuster .
478032	463200	408236	7.0	It's OK	Film version of the play . Based on fact it tells the story of a man ( Johnny Depp ) who is jailed ( for no good reason ) for 15 years . It was done by slimy Judge Turpin ( Alan Rickman ) because he wanted his wife and child . 15 years later he returns , adopts the name Sweeney Todd and sets out for vengeance . He's helped by Nellie Lovett ( Helena Bonham Carter ) who uses the meat from his victims to put into her meat pies which become VERY popular . I saw the play back in 1980 with Angela Landsbury and George Hearn . I remember loving it and the acting was superb . This version just doesn't match up - - it can't ! Tim Burton correctly shoots it in seriously drained color and he gets a superb performance by Depp and young Ed Sanders ( as Toby ) . Everybody can sing too . Also the murders are shown with blood gushing out - - once onto the camera lens ! Still it's impossible to take them seriously . Still this has its drawbacks . Carter is terrible - - she can sing but her acting is pretty dreadful . Rickman has done the evil act once too often - - and it shows . Also it's depressing ! It wears you down running on for two full hours . Some songs were cut out too - - I really miss " The Ballad of Sweeney Todd " . So - - it's not a disaster but it could have been so much better with a different leading lady and not cutting ANY of the songs . Depp really puts this film across though - - for him alone I give this a 7 .

Butch rips off a runner for local drug dealer , Tank , and is soon right back into his old habits of snorting coke and shooting up heroin with his best friend Lester . Enraged by Butch's affront and already determined to get revenge on him for a past wrong , Tank sets about getting even with his old enemy by hiring a hulking brute , Gates to beat Butch . When the confrontation occurs , however , Gates breaks his hand on the battle-hardened Butch . Besides Lester , the only people in Butch's corner are his two brothers , the mentally - unhinged Vietnam War veteran Louis and aspiring artist Ruby , neither of whom can be counted on to help him in the inevitable showdown . . . Julien Temple is fantastic at directing music videos , but when he comes to make movies , he sort of loses the plot ( see absolute beginners ) . i don't know where to start with this movie , but within the first ten minutes of the opening , we are treated to Rourke stripping two young boys , him stabbing someone in the eye , and Ted Levind doing his best buffalo bill impression this side of Silence of the lambs . to say the film was random would be an understatement , it's so confusing that it cannot help but to be enjoyed . Tupac turns up with an obvious grudge about something , swears a lot disappears for a while and come back later and do the same . basically the film has no plot , the narrative is poor to say the least , and when you see a man sitting in a pink Cadillac listening to ' i'm too sexy ' by right said Fred ' you know you are in trouble . but it's worth watching just for the randomness of the film

442367	819382	107007	8.0	Defines Epic .	Who's going to want to watch a movie about the American Civil War ? Oh , sure , maybe the public will watch an ageless soap opera like " Gone With the Wind " but a movie about nothing but a BATTLE ? No women in it ? No slashers ? No aliens or car chases or huge explosions or sex ? Americans have no interest in their own history . In a way , it's not too bad to have moguls in charge of things instead of a committee of MBAs whose eyes dart first to the bottom line . It USED to be this way in the movies when there was still a studio system and the Louis B . Mayers and Sam Goldwyns and Harry Cohns could manage ( or mismanage ) their empires as they liked . It used to be that way in publishing too . Mr . Simon and Mr . Schuster and Mr . Knopf and Mr . Scribner could print whatever they liked , even if they thought it would turn out to be a quality loser instead of an immensely profitable but brainless blockbuster . That's all pretty much changed now , and a lot of people would argue not for the better . So you have to give Ted Turner a lot of credit for financing this expensive production . As Ronald F . Maxwell , the director , put it - - " He followed his passion . " ( Cf . , Joseph Campbell , " Follow your bliss . " ) You have to give the reenactors credit for following their passions too . I doubt that they were paid although I expect they were fed . For what it's worth , the staging of the scene in which Lt . Chamberlain chats with three Confederate prisoners is copied directly from a Winslow Homer painting . It's an excellent movie , blending character study with action . Of the performances , I thought were Sheen as Lee , Lang as Pickett , Jordan as Armistad , and Mallon , who played Winfield Scott Hancock . Not that the other performances were poor . They're all up to professional snuff but , well , for instance , how much could Jeff Daniels do with a character who is a taciturn and inexpressive New Englander beyond speaking his lines woodenly ? I should also mention Lancaster as the British observer . He's pretty good . He comes across at first as simpering and dressed like a bellboy in a fancy French hotel , but when the situation calls for it his head tilts back and his eyes narrow searchingly . He does a splendid job of being just friendly enough to absorb information without expressing any opinions about the events he witnesses . It's a small part but nicely done . Stephen Lang's General Pickett is a descendant of the cavaliers who settled the South , gentlemanly , proud , brave , and filled with a kind of Errol Flynn factor . Sheen's Lee is thoughtful , religious , and wrong in his decisions . Jeb Stuart has a small part , as he did in the battle itself . He was given to riding in complete circles around the opposing Federal army and he did it at Gettysburg too , but that wasn't his job . I won't go on about the story of the battle itself because , if the MBAs are correct in their assumptions about you , any further discussion of the battle would be a spoiler for you . So - - no hints about who won . ( Ps : There is no Confederate States of America anymore . ) What a bloody and stupid war that was . Well , they all are of course , but some are unavoidable while others seem even more irrational than most . And the emotions generated by that conflict seem to persist beyond any real reason . It wasn't that long ago that roadside stands in the South displayed beach towels picturing a tattered Confederate soldier carrying the battle flag over his shoulder , and the caption , " Hell no , we won't forget . " Why not ? Nobody who fought that war is still alive . It's the sort of sentiment that will lead to the next war and the one after that .
450026	2093818	120663	8.0	Kubrick's final film . . . and possibly his least impressive	After having seen just about every single of Kubrick's films ( The only films that are left are Spartacus , Lolita and his short films ) and a documentary about him ( Stanley Kubrick : A Life in Pictures ) , I was looking forward to seeing his last film , despite it's reputation . Now that I've seen it , I'm not sure what to think . . . I don't know for sure if I agree with the common opinion that this is his least impressive film ( even less impressive than The Shining ) . Don't get me wrong , it is a good film , but it just seems . . . I don't know , unfinished , rushed . . . like Kubrick didn't spend as much time filming as he should have . Maybe it's the actors , I don't know . It just seems . . . uneven , somehow . The plot is very good , and has a pretty good pace . . . but there are places where you're bored , and the film seemed to end too suddenly , I think ( despite the film being quite long ) . The acting is , not unlike The Shining , less impressive than most of Kubrick's other films . Cruise is not an actor with a lot of range , that's for sure . Kidman is mostly believable , but , like Cruise , she seems more like an actor playing a part than the actual character , which distances us from their characters and thereby from the film itself . Not good . The characters are well-written , credible and interesting . The story is interesting , evolves at a very good pace and provides food for thought . I liked how the film presented infidelity and sex in general as acts lust and desire rather than affiliating them with love or emotion . I've heard many complain that the film was lacking sex scenes . This is a Kubrick film ; just because the subject matter is directly intertwined with sex , doesn't mean that he's going to do the typical , simple Hollywood thing and just pack the movie with sex scenes . A talentless director could ( and probably would ) have done that . Anyone can make sex look appealing to the general public . It's much , much harder to make it seem unappealing and in fact almost disgusting . . . but Kubrick succeeds . He reminds us that sex is just a bodily function , something between two people that doesn't actually require emotions . It's physical by nature . The soundtrack is quite good too . . . there is a classical piece that can bring you to the edge of your seat just listening to it , and Kubrick pairs it up with great visuals . Maybe I should let you know that , while this I think this is one of his lesser films , it is still definitely a Kubrick piece . No doubt about it . Perfectly framed shots , slow pans and zooms , great music . . . and the ending , albeit being a bit sudden and leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied , still has the Kubrick touch and , whilst appearing to resolve the film , it also hints at something more sinister and unsettling . A good , maybe even great , film by the master of innovative storytelling , Stanley Kubrick . I recommend it to any fan of Kubrick . Anyone who isn't a fan , or at the very least isn't used to his style of film , should consider watching some of his other films first , as this is one of his heavier and less impressive ones ( at least in my opinion ) .
438892	1617546	770	6.0	Performances	This is an early Griffith effort - - when you're turning out eighty or ninety movies a year , you look everywhere for a story . A full reel , this was an immense production in Griffith's schedule and it shows . Although it is shot in simple long takes and the crowd scenes are staged well but not as amazingly so as later efforts would do , this has a full and beautiful set , in an era when set dressing was practically non-existent . The acting is broad in the comedy scenes , and more controlled in the romantic scenes . Notice the background actors gesticulating wildly in the kitchen scene ( and the trademark ' AB ' ! ) which looks looks a lot like Sennet's later Keystone style . Although Griffith directed more than five hundred pictures , almost all of which survive , he has a vast corpus of works that are rarely seen , because so many people concentrate on his best features and perhaps a dozen of his best-known shorts . Kino is to be applauded for including this in their silent OTHELLO dvd and for hiring John Mirsalis to do the delightful , simple score .
371932	2488512	404777	6.0	A Clumsy Anti-Hero Is Born	When a thief driving a motorcycle steals a purse of a pedestrian , the clumsy , naive and honest rookie policeman Sang-hwan ( Seung-beom Ryu ) runs after him , but the skilled specialist in martial arts Wi-jin ( So-yi Yoon ) captures the criminal and Sang-hwan is severely injured . She brings Sang-hwan to her home , where the six Masters of Tao heal him and believe that he has a powerful Qi , the spiritual energy of the universe , and could be a powerful warrior . Sang-hwan begins his training to ascend to a Maruchi , while the evil and ambitious Heuk-woon ( Doo-hong Jung ) is accidentally released from his imprisonment . The powerful Heuk-woon attacks the masters , searching a key that they protect , which would permit him to become an Arahan and dominate the world . When the masters are defeated , Sang-hwan and Wi-jin are the only hope to mankind . " Arahan " has great special effects , a nice cast and could be a good action movie . Unfortunately the comedy never works , with the clumsy anti-hero Sang-hwan being a confused not-funny character . Maybe this type of humor works in other cultures , but I did not like it . The developments of the rich characters is weak , and maybe in Asian cultures the concepts of Qi and Tao are clear , but at least for me , I was forced to research about these concepts of the Chinese culture to understand their meanings . But for fans like me of South-Korean movies , " Arahan " is essential . Title Brazil ) : " Arahan "
548406	1111192	450314	9.0	This Punisher is brutal .	Yes , this movie unlike the previous two Punisher movies really is what the Punisher comic book character is like . It is also very poorly received by movie critics as they just were aghast of all the violence in the film , most of which involves the Punisher doing away with criminals in rather satisfying fashion . I really enjoyed this incarnation of the Punisher myself , as like I said it portrays the Punisher as he is portrayed in the comics more than any other film . Granted I enjoyed the one with Thomas Jane quite a lot as well . As for the story , once again it is not a sequel so knowing either of the other two movies is not necessary to enjoy this film . Liking bad guys getting killed in very gruesome ways and not minding lots of blood are rather necessary for liking this film . The film does not show how the Punisher came to be except in brief flashback scenes , however , the flashbacks are more in line with how it happened in the comics . Right of the bat , the Punisher goes in and kills a lot of mob types in a rather grisly and gruesome shoot em up . Very nice start , as there was more gun play in this opening sequence than in the entire Max Payne movie released this same year . After taking care of a mansion full of these guys he heads to the docks where he accidentally shoots an insider from the FBI and really does a number on one particular mob guy who really liked his own looks . What happens next is an FBI agent now wants to really bring in the Punisher for the death of the inside guy , Frank ( Punisher ) is thinking of not being the Punisher because of this death , and the mobster becomes the crime boss Jigsaw and breaks his crazy brother out of jail to try and get revenge on the Punisher . So you get lots of kills to follow in a very wild ride . Lots of bullets expended as well , and a rather satisfying conclusion as the Punisher really takes care of business and pounds the bad guys .
544282	562732	85809	10.0	Kind of like 2001 : A Space Odyssey , but without the constant barrage of dialogue . . .	Koyaanisqatis is an extremely unusual film , and by far one of the most unusual I have ever seen . It takes on the daunting task of portraying the history of the world until modern times ( or the early 80s , at least ) entirely without dialogue . It is a documentary of sorts , in that it is amazingly informative , but it is filmed like a Hollywood film . Expertly framed shots and flawlessly smooth camera movement and shot composition . There is an unbelievable amount of talent behind this film , both in the fascinating images that are presented and the mesmerizing score by Philip Glass . It is a very slow moving film , but it manages to keep your attention because , in many cases , it is just so interesting to see the things that are portrayed and the way that they are shown . This is the only film , for example , where you can see a shot of a 737 approaches directly toward the camera over a hot runway in a shot that is possibly over a minute long with no movement other than the sluggish lumbering of the massive plain . Godfrey Reggio takes Glass's score and places images over it that add to the sound and create an experience that is far greater than , as they say , the sum of its parts . The shots contain camera movement or lack movement , are sped up or slowed down , and have live sound or no live sound depending on the desired effect , and the end result is absolutely hypnotic . This is a wonderful cinematic experience for people of all ages , and possibly my favorite thing about this film and it's successors is that , because they have no dialogue , they can be shown in any country in the world and not have to worry about subtitles or even altered meanings . This is a film for humanity .
409425	2567136	792965	7.0	Full House	Claude Berri is a director who often seems on the verge of becoming a name outside France but somehow doesn't quite make it . His films are interesting - One Leaves , The Other Stays - to excellent - Lucie Aubrac with very little dross . Now he's taken a popular French novel and cast Audrey Tautou in a lead for which she's almost but not quite suited . She plays a gifted anorexic artist who has elected to work as a cleaner to her mother's disappointment . She becomes friendly with an eccentric aristocrat , Laurent Stocker , who lives in an immense apartment which he shares more or less unaccountably with a surly chef , Guillaume Canet . When he realizes that Camille ( Tautou ) is ill Philbert ( Stocker ) takes her to live in his apartment and nurses her back to health , this allows for the Benedict and Beatrice element between Tautou and womanizer Canet who also has an elderly grandmother in hospital . Against the odds the three form a bond and bring the grandmother into the menage when she leaves hospital and that's about it . Stocker , who generates all of the action tends to become low man on his own totem pole so that his own development as an actor who finds his own romance takes something of a back seat to Tautou and Canet . Never less than interesting it doesn't quite make it to the next level .
486829	386241	86141	4.0	- all of them for Kay Lenz	This stereotypical , low-grade fantasy lacks both the budget and the directorial imagination to be really exciting . The only epic thing about it is the music score . The film is too cheesy for most adults , but it also has some unpleasant scenes that are unsuitable for kids - making you wonder what audience exactly they had in mind . What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz : she's both endearing and feisty , and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry . Her face has a great " bone structure " - she looks a bit like Kim Basinger ( trivia note : they were born the same year , 1953 ) , only more beautiful . And she can even keep a straight face through lines like " But . . . . he's green ! " ( when the male lead suggests that they should follow a man ) . Take Lenz out of the movie and you don't have a movie - just a midget , a giant , an evil John Saxon , and other stereotypes . ( )
516920	1132073	313542	9.0	Runaway Jury !	Runaway Jury is a pretty good film . It has an unusual and interesting all star cast ! This cast includes Gene Hackman , Rachel Weisz , Dustin Hoffman , and John Cusack ! Other cast members include Cliff Curtis , Bruce Davidson , Luis Guzman , Orlando Jones , Dylan McDermott , Gerry Bamman , Leland Orser , Jeremy Piven , Bruce McGill , Joanna Going , Jennifer Beals , Nick Searcy , and Bill Nunn ! All of the actors and actresses were very good ! I think Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz played the highlight characters especially Weisz ! Really she had the big part in the movie but Hackman is as ruthless as he has ever been in a film ! Fantastic acting by one of the best ! The music is by one of My favorite composers Christopher Young . His score is much different than his others . The movie itself in intense at times and the action scene with Rachel Weisz was a surprise ! Its a fair movie but if you like thrilling drama films then I recommended you watch Runaway Jury Today !

Phlox convinces Captain Archer that the only way to save Trip is developing a symbiotic using a Lyssarian worm and then transplanting a brain nervous system . Archer authorizes the procedure but he has troubles with the fast-growing clone that has Trip memories and his own personality together . Meanwhile the Enterprise is trapped without propulsion in a dangerous particles field . " Similitude " is a good episode where the ethical issue of using clone to replace parts is exposed . I immediately recalled " The Island " , proving that the cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied laws . Unfortunately the plot is disclosed in the very beginning , but the ambiguous feeling of Sim ( or Trip ? ) for T'Pol is rewarded with her farewell kiss . Title ( Brazil ) : " Semelhança " ( " Resemblance " )
522337	4445210	94847	10.0	Possibly The Best Cartoon I've Ever Seen	I have seen a lot of funny cartoons , but very few which brought a big smile to my face the entire duration of the film . I just could not believe how good this was , from the hilarious animation - mainly " Mr . Johnson , " to the clever jokes that are in here one after the other after the other . Kudos to Cordell Barker for his story , direction and animation . It's an unbelievably entertaining . story of guy who finds a little yellow cat on his welcome mat outside one day , and how this cat literally destroys the house and the owner . It also shows the many attempts the man makes to get rid of the cat but , as the title say , he keeps coming back . I can see why this was nominated for an Oscar . What I don't understand is why it didn't win . I don't know how you can make a cartoon any betterThere is a DVD out , named " Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada . If for no other reason than this cartoon , purchasing that DVD would be worthwhile because this animated short is one of the best ever made
439144	1617546	36317	6.0	Their Best Comedy - - Don't Cry If You Miss It	Carney and Brown were two minor supporting comedians whom RKO teamed , hoping for the same chemistry - - and profits ! - - that Universal was getting out of Abbott and Costello . But whereas A & C were two guys who had spent twelve years honing their act and timing , this pair had to move on their acting ability , which was decent , and their chemistry - - which , alas , was non-existent . Strangely enough , this , their cheapest feature - - no supporting acts , no songs - - is , I think , their best . I credit Leslie Goodwins , the director , who usually spent his time in the shorts department directing Leon Erroll and Edgar Kennedy shorts . There are some very funny gags scattered about . A surprising amount of comic energy is supplied by Erford Gage , who plays their sergeant in this and ADVENTURES OF A ROOKIE . He also gets to pull the best gag in the movie , something you'd expect to see in a Merrie Melody . So this movie is not a waste of time . But it does make you appreciate Abbott and Costello all the more .
366273	3109237	79946	5.0	" Halt the flow of time ! "	Writing any sort of review on Starcrash is difficult . The plot is hardly worth rehashing as it's little more than a mish-mash of ideas taken ( i . e . stolen ) from other movies . Writing about the poor technical aspects of the movie is like shooting fish in a barrel ? not much of a challenge . And it would be a waste of time to discuss the bad special effects ? why restate the obvious ? It's one of those movies that must be seen to be believed . Also , coming up with a rating for Starcrash is equally difficult . Starcrash is just plain old bad . But it's the kind of bad that's cheesy , campy , and , ultimately , entertaining for those who enjoy wallowing in such things . So I've decided to take the easy way out and rate Starcrash a wishy-washy . Bad ? ? Yes . Entertaining ? ? Definitely . Instead of a regular review , I've decided to make a list of the things I took away from my experience with Starcrash : 1 . Starcrash is in no way a Star Wars rip-off . It's a Star Wars / Jason and the Argonauts / Barbarella rip-off . 2 . When going into battle , exploring unknown worlds , or doing any other physically demanding activity , be smart and dress appropriately . Thigh-high stiletto boots and a leather bikini appear to be the outfit of choice . 3 . Maybe it has something to do with life support , but heavy eye make-up and hairspray appear to be essential for survival on distant planets . 4 . Explosions in space are almost identical to what you might see at a July 4 fireworks display . 5 . Christopher Plummer can deliver the most ridiculous , idiotic dialogue as if it were Shakespeare . 6 . If you take a bunch of ordinary household items and stick them together just right , you to can create a real starship . 7 . Lava lamps can be dangerous when they go on a rampage . 8 . Apparently , you can break a window out of a space ship with no worries . 9 . Marjoe ? 10 . Man - Hasselhoff had one helluva girlish bouffant .
370423	2488512	51587	7.0	Good Epic of Betrayal and Revenge	When Marco Antonio is defeated by his enemies , his former allied King Herod of Judea ( Edmund Purdom ) travels to convince Augustus to support his government by the Romans . He makes his chief commander and friend Aaron ( Alberto Lupo ) swear that he would kill his beloved Queen Miriam ( Sylvia Lopez ) if he died . When Herod is arrested by the Romans , one of his men returns to Judea and lies , telling that he was killed by the Romans . However Aaron is not able to keep his promise and Miriam stays alive . When Herode returns to his palace , his son Antipater , poisons Herode with the lie that Aaron has betrayed him and had an affair with Miriam . The madness of Herode destroys his friends and his kingdom . " Erode il grande " is a good epic of betrayal and revenge in a nest of snakes . The theatrical performance of Edmund Purdom is very exaggerated and quite ridiculous in the love scenes with Sylvia Lopez , but in the rest of the movie he works well . The character of Antipater seems to be inspired in Iago of Shakespeare's Othello . Unfortunately the DVD released in Brazil by the distributor London Films is horribly dubbed in English , and the quality of the image is awful . But this movie is a worthwhile entertainment if the viewer disregard the previously mentioned problems . Title ( Brazil ) : " Herodes o Grande " ( " Herode The Great " )
408052	865972	390170	6.0	Mildly interesting Thai horror flick .	Arawati was a beautiful girl among Khmer villagers cornered in battle . She was sentenced to death after being caught in a secret affair with a young soldier . Burnt alive , her soul remained in her head and bowels . At the same time in another town , village beauty Dao died . Tarawati's soul took the chance to occupy Dao's corpse . At night , her head and entrails join the occupied body to drift in the air looking for prey . The premise of " Krasue " is certainly interesting , but the special effects are weak and there is not enough gore . The acting is average at its best and CGI-animated flying vampiric head looks unconvincing . Frankly the film is pretty dull as it's filled with a lot of boring talk between the characters . Still the cinematography is gorgeous and there are some memorable moments including the fight scene between a flying vampire head with guts hanging underneath and cobra . Give it a look , if you have enough time to kill . .
382722	449021	109592	7.0	aka The Cemetery Man . Italian cult classic .	This zombie movie is not as cheesy as say NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD . Rupert Everett plays Francesco Dellamorte , a watchman / caretaker of the local cemetery . A bizarre thing begins to happen that makes his job more tedious . The dead arise after being in their grave for seven days . To kill them again , you have to crush their skull or shoot them in the head . This dark story is not without its moments of humor . Profuse violence and the gore appears real . Lighting or lack of , sets the mood perfectly . Great for a weekend rental . Better seen later in the evening the better . Anna Falchi and Fabiana Formica have memorable roles .
468452	1532177	225481	4.0	Not So Much Scream . . . .	. . . As a yawn - a very big yawn I must be getting old because I have trouble watching two horror films in a row . I'd previously just seen SEVERED which is also known to this reviewer as 28 BADLY DIRECTED TRIFFIDS LATER and had difficulty in staying awake watching THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING . This probably sums up the problem with the movie in that it's fairly inoffensive and unmemorable so makes little impression on its intended market . It's obviously produced to tie in with the SCREAM franchise but that series was far from being the witty post modernist genius some claim it to be so right away you're being influenced by something that wasn't very good to begin with which leads to ZZZZZZZZZZ

Treasure hunter Ben Gates ( Nicolas Cage ) is on another adventure trying to prove one of ancestors was not involved with the assassination of President Lincoln . The proof will be in a secret book intended for presidential eyes only , handed down for generations . Gates and his partner Riley ( Justin Bartha ) will have to outrace another historian ( Ed Harris ) to a long lost " city of gold " . Clues will lead to the Statue of Liberty in New York and one of its mates in Paris . The trail of clues will go to Buckingham Palace ; the Oval Office ; " kidnapping " the President ( Bruce Greenwood ) ; the Library of Congress and Mount Rushmore . There will be the need of some assistance from Ben's estranged wife ( Diane Kruger ) , his dad ( Jon Voight ) and his mother ( Helen Mirren ) . The scenery is pretty awesome and zinging one liners that are actually funny . Your attention will be on the movie throughout . Also in the cast : Harvey Keitel , Alicia Coppola and Ty Burrell .
400733	7743887	918015	8.0	" If that's a Scientologist , I'll serve him with chips ! "	Shelley's attempts to prepare a dinner party meet with continual interruptions ; first , a Jehovah's Witness rings the doorbell and refuses to go away , then an elderly neighbour called Mrs . Ratcliffe asks him to fix her shelf . Mrs . Ratcliffe is , unfortunately , senile , and thinks that all the women at that address - Mrs . H included - are on the game . Jim thinks up an ingenious way to get these time wasters off his back - he introduces them to each other . The party begins before Shelley has had time to clear up the flat , so his guests helpfully oblige by doing it for him . It ends in disaster . A row breaks out when two guests let slip that they have been having an affair . . . The final episode of Series 1 ( though as I've stated in earlier reviews it was not broadcast as such ) owes a small debt to the classic ' Porridge ' episode ' No Peace For The Wicked ' , though its nowhere near as funny . As the interruptions increase , so Shelley's anger rises , though he stops short of actually throttling someone ( as Fletcher did ) . Spot The Future Star : yes , that is Alan Rickman as the hippie-like ' Clive ' . The man who would go on to star in ' Die Hard ' , ' Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves ' and ' Galaxy Quest ' amongst other hit films is seen here in a minor role . A major problem is that we never actually see the blazing row the party degenerates into . We are simply told about it . Obnoxious Ned is present , and makes matters worse by lecherously winking at Trish and exclaiming : ' Everybody's doing it ! " . As the party takes place off-screen , we are thankfully spared a return appearance by David Pugh as ' Ned ' . One good thing to be said for it , I suppose . The best bits are Shelley's interaction with the Jehovah's Witness ( haven't we all wanted to tell them to go forth and multiply ? ) and Mrs . Ratcliffe . Funniest moment - Jim telling the former to leave the premises , adding that if he comes back he'll turn him into a pillar of salt !
404914	2020269	91338	3.0	Sorority Girls just want to have fun ?	" Killer Party " is a pretty dumb and righteously forgotten mid-80's horror-comedy that only gets funny when it's meant to look serious and vice versa . That's quite painful already , and it gets gradually worse with bad acting and total lack of gore or inventive gimmicks . After not one , but TWO ( not even counting the super cheesy music video ) misleading opening sequences , we're introduced to three cheerful girl friends that desperately want to be part of a prominent campus sorority of which the name has already slipped my mind . They're accepted , but only because one of them ? Vivia ? is a master in pulling April fool's pranks . The girls are referred to as " goats " ( quite appropriately ) and they're assigned to freak out the boys of a frat club during a party held at a haunted frat house . What follows next is a series of lame red herrings disguised as fraternity pranks and a handful of bloodless killings , supposedly committed by a student who died in the house 20 years ago . Is it all a set-up ? Will the girls ever bath naked in the hot tub again ? Do we honestly even care ? ? With the exception of lead actress Elaine Wilkes ' portrayal of Phoebe , all the characters are completely insufferable and their deaths nearly weren't painful enough in my opinion . " Killer Party " is boring up until the last fifteen minutes , then it gets over-the-top campy and totally implausible . Not even the spirited guest appearance of Paul Bartel ( " Eating Raoul " , " Death Race 2000 " ) as the grumpy teacher can save this movie from being an utter mess . Check out " April Fool's Day " , instead .
548554	1111192	186339	7.0	Industrial robots on the rampage .	Yes , called Mega Man in the United States this game would be the first of many titles in this series . Though I wonder why it is called Rockman in Japan , is it because they equate him to a rock somehow or is he rocking cool ? Anyways in this game the evil Dr . Wiley has turned his robots evil , robots that were initially used for various construction and such type jobs . You have one who uses fire , a cold one , an electrical one , a bomb expert , one who cuts , and a strong one . As the title character you must progress through these characters deadly levels and defeat each one and gain their powers so that you can infiltrate Dr . Wiley's stronghold and go toe to toe with the evil creator himself . The game was rather fun for its time , though I found a few levels especially annoying , the first time I played it I especially had difficulty facing the first boss in Dr . Wiley's place . A creature that flies into the room a part and you must dodge each part or suffer damage and then when totally together you can shoot him once and he does it again . Granted , on subsequent playings I did not have all that much trouble against him . You also have another headache in this game common in many games of this era , the pit with no end . You know , the bottom of the screen has no floor , you fall in , and you instantly die . It is fun trying to figure out what villains powers can work against the others effectively and for the most part this game is a fun game , though part II is more fun . . . granted the enemy robots would start getting a tad strange as the series goes on , like Pharaoh man .

This was her next-to-last one and has aired on the Sundance Channel . Even the more commercial work they did to help pay the bills has a special quality to it and I've yet to see anything that wasn't interesting to watch in some area , even the one or two I didn't care for . They had one Oscar winner I haven't seen and dearly wish I could ( Herb Alpert and the Tiajuana Brass Double Feature ) and I hope her last short airs on Sundance or some other location as I'd love to see it sometime , Recommended .

508775	453068	477785	3.0	she should have just done an interview , not a movie that screams pretension like no other	I know Guy Maddin directed this short film , My Dad is 100 Years Old , but either acclaim or blame should be rest on Isabella Rossellini's shoulders for this . She knew what kind of picture this would be , and Maddin seems more like a hired hand here than a true visionary . And if anything , the vision of sorts is really distracting and unnecessary and is just really poorly done . I know the intentions are good , and if I had to rate just on intentions it would be much higher praising , albeit in such personal terms . Roberto Rossellini is a great filmmaker , one of the greatest that emerged once the smoke settled from World War 2 in Europe . And his films Open City and Paisan are films that should be rediscovered for years to come as technology overcomes the film industry ( even if it's just in museums ) . But one of his daughter's , Isabella , hasn't done the greatest of tributes , from my perspective , with her My Dad is 100 Years Old short film . There isn't really anything coherent to the picture , which might have been acceptable had it been maybe more focused , so to speak . What I mean is the same pretension that she seems to be commenting on ( although too little too late by the last shot when she calls for the camera to move in front of her directly in profile ) , and done with a very ' this is how it is ' take on things . She makes fun of Fellini and Hitchcock ( the latter in profile , the former played by her ) , as Rossellini himself - or the form of him as portrayed by a huge belly that Isabella recollects was what she remembers the most - rags on anything in cinema that doesn't address morality and the like . Only when Chaplin comes out - also again Rossellini herself playing her along with David O Selznik - does some praise come out . For a film that lasts only 15-17 minutes , it seems like it fills up its time much too smugly and with an air of content at being all over the place . It's interesting to see how the rest of the picture , with its obtuse camera angles and pompous style of editing and framing and dialog , compares with the few precious clips of Open City that are shown , and how more insight into the director is in those clips than in everything else his daughter shows . Now , in full disclosure , I do like Isabella Rossellini a lot , as an actress , and she is a beautiful woman , but taking the controls on a complete tribute project like this nears all too much to the point of disaster . We get a view of a man who is simply all alone , out-casted by a film community that once embraced him , and sullen by the fact that people don't care about his movies after a while , or the kinds of stories and characters he wants to portray . It sounds really good on the outset , but it's not what I thought it would be when I finally saw it - a mess . I would have much rather had seen a full-on documentary on the director instead of some avant-garde deconstructionist short film . A big disappointment from a big fan of the director .
532625	70535	111359	1.0	Should have called this one ' Small Tail "	I searched for one word to describe this film and came up with dumb . That seems to fit the entire boring , badly acted , silly scripted , nonsensical mess . What was Swayze doing in this production anyway , he is usually in a more mainstream element ? I doubt if even a child got anything out of this screwy movie . I can't say anymore , it was just a bad show .
421568	2542703	31377	9.0	Golden Boy - A Gem in A Golden 1939 Year	1939 remains a golden year for motion pictures and this film is absolutely no exception . William Holden is excellent as a violin player turned boxer who sacrifices all for making money to help his father and be someone . The father is played in a positively brilliant performance by Lee J . Cobb . Cobb dons an Italian accent here and conveys utter sympathy as the poor shop owner who only wants the best for his son . Adolphe Menjou and Barbara Stanwyck play lovers who stumble on Holden ( Joe Bonaparte ) and want to get him to the top to make the all important dough . Joseph Calleia plays the heavy here as a mafia-like gangster who wants a part of Joe as well . Even with the fancy clothes and change in lifestyle , Holden was unable to convey the change unless this is what the author , Clifford Odets , wanted . A tragedy ensues in the ring only to make Bonaparte a better person and Stanwyck , realizing her love for him , abandons Menjou as the two return to his father . It should be noted that Bonaparte has a sister in the film , who gives a clumsy imitation of Gracie Allen . Sam Levene , plays her cab driver husband , in a role that was made for him . Menjou , as the promoter , and Stanwyck , as a woman who regrets pushing Bonaparte in the ring , are excellent . This is certainly an anti-boxing film
486574	386241	113855	6.0	Good of its type .	Although I've never actually played the game , I found this movie surprisingly entertaining . It had plenty of visual pyrotechnics to keep the viewer interested , some impressively shot fight scenes ( the standouts ? Johnny Cage vs Scorpio and Kang vs Reptile ) and a comic , spoofy flair that worked as the perfect antidote to the moments of solemnity . Except for Lambert ( who is awful ) and Bridgette Wilson ( who is beautiful but can't act ) , the cast is adequate , with a particularly likable performance by Linden Ashby as the sarcastic Johnny Cage . And what a pulsating music score ! ( )
568780	2721657	402743	6.0	A Man called Bigfoot	SPOILERS Terrifying Bigfoot / Sasquatch horror movie with the rampaging Bigfoot monster , played to perfection by Michael Deak , tearing the whole movie set apart with almost the films entire cast and crew . When people stated to encroach into his secret forest domain outside the town of Flatwoods the big guy , Bigfoot , just about had enough of the human race and everything that goes with it . Without breaking a sweat the usually big as an 800 pound guerrilla but harmless as a toy poodle Bigfoot went bananas and broke into a number of homes outside city limits making his presences felt . It just happened that the crippled , in both mind and body , mountain climber Preston Rogers , Matt McCoy , was sent by his doctor , for rest and relaxation , to stay at his former home in the deep woods where Bigfoot decided to put his big foot down . Bigfoot had been raiding the local farmers livestock earlier in the movie but now for some reason decided to attack man whom he considers , unlike the livestock , his mortal and eternal enemy . We get the usual sexy , and willing to take their clothes off , teenage or collage student who get themselves , with the also usual exception of a single survivor among them , knocked off by the Bigfoot who also devourers them . This is something new for Bigfoot since it was always thought that he was a vegetarian ! Preston who's being taken care of by , what seems like , his male nurse Otis , Christian Tinsley , sees the Bigfoot running around his front lawn but his cries fall on deft ears . Otis thinks he's , from the fall he suffered with his wife ending up dead , completely nuts . As for the girls the collage students next door , or in the next cabin , they think that Preston is just another pervert or Peeping Tom trying to get a good look at them , with heir clothes off , with his binoculars . The Bigfoot finally comes out of hiding when he attacks and kills a number of hunters , Lance Henriksen Jeffrey Combs & Rex Linn , for uncovering one of his recent kills : Collage student Karen Herdberger , Ashley Hartman . The Bigfoot attacked Karen and dragged her into his secret cave where he was in the process , when hunter Henriksen discovered it , of preparing his dinner with Karen as the main course ! With Preston Otis and the girls trapped with no place to go the Bigfoot now went into action as he tore into his human adversaries with both teeth claws as well , with his scent , as his extremely offensively strong body odor ; By far the worst weapon in his entire arsenal . The movie ends with the Bigfoot getting a king-size stomach ache but only after killing off almost the entire movie cast including Otis who was left with his face completely bitten off ! Not that bad of an acting job by both Bigfoot impersonator Michael Deak and the hero of the film , playing the paralyzed Preston Rogers , actor Matt McCoy . Bigfoot did have things going his way in killing livestock and collage student together with armed to the teeth hunters but when he started messing with Mister , Preston , Rogers ' Neighborhood he just went a bit to far . Far enough to get himself crushed in the heavy forest traffic !
433782	2171244	814075	8.0	A difficult review to write	I am having a hard time with this review as I am a recovering Catholic who spent the first 18 years of his life totally immersed in the Church , even to the point of a year in seminary . It wasn't until these scandals broke added to the fact that I was a child protective services worker dealing with sexual abuse of children at the time , that I made a break with the church . I even requested excommunication and removal of my name from the church rolls , but that process was halted when my parish priest was removed for sexual abuse himself . With that disclaimer , I can say that this was certainly a hard film to watch . The lies , distortions , cover-ups , and stalling of church officials in Los Angeles will just serve to make you more angry after watching the film . Amy Berg did an outstanding job of showing just how the actions of the church damages the faithful , how the predators rationalize and deny what they have done , and how politics and promotion are more important to church officials than protection of children . Knowing how pervasive this sin is in the clergy will only make you more angry . This is a must-see documentary for all Catholics .
450474	2093818	482276	7.0	. . . but it's true !	This is the seventh and final ( going by the order on the DVD , well , the one I own , at least ) short featurette on the disc of Team America : World Police , each going into a specific subject of that film . Kim Jong-Il is the focus of this one , with one or two more broad details in there ( you'll never believe what caused Elliott and others a lot of problems ) . How he was thought up , the design of him and his puppet . It consists of interviews , behind-the-scenes footage , conceptual art and clips of the movie . Matt and Trey give the very best comments , and are by far the funniest to listen to in this , but all have good stuff to add . Parker's " big dream " is absolutely priceless . It's interesting to hear how much of the character is based on research , not made up . This is edited well . Pacing is good , it's hard to go too slow at the five minutes long this is , but it also doesn't move overly fast . The language isn't an issue in this , so the only censor-notable thing here is the violence ( none of which involves actual human beings ) . I recommend this to any fan of TA , and anyone who wants to know more about the villain of it .
428096	3079504	470402	7.0	bloody comedy is a great deal of fun if you can stand the gore and click into its goofy wavelength	Thai comedy can be painfully funny . There is often a sense that anything goes so long as it gets a laugh , the result is wild crazy out of left field quality that is totally endearing . A perfect example of this is this movie . The plot has a mutation of the Sars virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies getting loose in an apartment complex in Bangkok . The zombies present complications for a kidnapped girl and her rescuers who are trying to flee the building . Bloody , over the top and very silly this is the sort of knowing comedy that more often than not fails to work in other films . Here the balance between blood and laughs if finely balanced , or at least piled on so thick that there is enough good stuff with the bad that you can't help but find something to laugh at . From references to the George Romero zombie films , Star Wars to martial arts spectaculars and Italian horror films this is a movie that steals from the best and puts it all together into a gumbo of entertaining proportions . Its not perfect , there's often too much going on , and the filmmakers don't always feel the need to have the film make sense , but its an enjoyable romp for those who can take the blood and body parts .
385444	391152	28275	7.0	Decent short , but more of a curio for Tati fans	Wow , Tati was a young man . Here he plays someone's young son , 17 years before M . Hulot's Holiday . The action centers around a boxing match between a champ and Tati , who knows nothing about boxing and has to consult a manual during the fight . It sounds funnier than it really is . Chaplin's boxing match in City Lights is much , much better . The editing of this film can be confusing . Still , it is funny . It's worth a . See it on Criterion's M . Hulot's Holiday DVD , recently released .
486025	386241	67277	7.0	Half powerful , half pretentious .	This unique movie has many powerful moments and could have been a masterpiece , if it were less pretentiously directed . There are some strange and rather absurd " fantasy " sequences that don't really work - for example , Donald Sutherland is billed as " Jesus Christ " , and he isn't very convincing in the role . Still , it's an important movie , and well worth watching .
490188	33913	92336	9.0	Deserved to be a Hit !	I remember this show fondly because it was filmed in New York City on location without a laugh track or studio audience which was quite a departure for a sitcom about a single woman in the thirties played by the wonderful Blair Brown as Molly Dodd . She must deal with her mother played by the equally wonderful Allyn Ann McLerie . I don't remember ever seeing Molly's brother and sister twins , Mamie and Dwight Dodds who lived in the suburbs . Molly's single life is far from the Sex in the City girls . It was more realistic and believable about Molly trying to find the right man and job . I remember it first on network later on lifetime before it ceased completely from television . The cast and crew were first rate and the writing was simply wonderful just like Molly's life .
491710	3280905	45607	6.0	Lucille Toody's Favorite Movie	I enjoyed this comedy , which demonstrates that one can't have one's cake and eat it too . Alec Guiness has found that he has a perfect recipe for happiness by being a bigamist . He has one wife in Gibraltar ( Celia Johnson ) and one in Ceuta ( Yvonne De Carlo ) . As his business is running a ferry service between the two cities he has reason to be gone at least a night or two from either wife . He chooses Celia to mirror the perfect domestic spouse , and Yvonne for the perfect excitement spouse . But in truth both women are increasingly unhappy by the uneven state of their marriages . Johnson wants to go out with her husband to night spots , and De Carlo wants to cook him a dinner , and maybe play some bridge or charades with him . Instead of willingly switching the formula , Guiness foolishly prevents both women from getting their desire , and looses them both . Ironically they never discover he committed bigamy . It is not as good as " The Lavender Hill Mob " , or " The Ladykillers " , or " The Man in the White Suit " or " The Horse's Mouth " , but it is as good as " The Card " . Although admittedly second tier Guiness it is popular . It is also the only film of Guiness's to be mentioned in the television series " Car 54 Where Are You ? " . Lucille Toody thought it was so romantic . Imagine Gunther with two wives in the Bronx and Queens ?
367586	2707735	54757	7.0	" Monsieur , words are what men live by , words are what they mean " .	It didn't take me long to get beyond the opening scene's mention of it being 1843 , and the idea that Paul Regret ( Stuart Whitman ) got to walk away from a hanging for killing the son of a ranking official in a duel . After that it's all entertainment value in the pairing of Whitman and John Wayne in a lively Western that introduces additional colorful characters along the way . There's not much chance of forgetting Lee Marvin as the rabble rousing Tully Crow ; you couldn't bet going in that he wouldn't have lasted much more than a few minutes the way his character was presented . Then there was Edgar Buchanan in the kind of role he was born to play as the conniving Circuit Court Judge who gets to see it the Ranger way . I was also impressed by Big Boy Guinn Williams in his last movie appearance , looking a lot older than I'm used to , but delivering the ' real ' Ed McBain in a credible role . The interesting thing about the picture is that it keeps twisting and turning in different directions , and you never quite see what's coming clearly . There's a good mix of action , humor and camaraderie with Wayne playing off his co-stars as well as any picture I've seen him in . And of course , the Utah and Arizona location filming is pleasing to the eye . " The Comancheros " is one of those films that seems to make regular rounds of the cable channels , so catching it shouldn't be much of a problem . It's worth a viewing if you can disregard the historical inaccuracies and concentrate on the performances of the principals . Wayne and Whitman have a great chemistry together , and along with the scenery , Ina Balin does a commendable job as the daughter of a Comanchero renegade and Paul Regret's love interest .
483761	1416505	218839	7.0	Some good fun to watch .	If you like a more subtle comedy , this is a great movie for you to watch . It features a wide variety of a bunch of odd characters and a main story situated around a dog-show . Well , to be honest , there isn't really much story in this movie actually . It's a fake documentary , or mockumentary , focusing on the world of dog-shows and their owners . The first halve of the movie mostly consists out of fake interviews with the characters about them and their dogs , while the second halve concentrates more on the travel to - and the actual dog-show . The movie is not always made credible as a fake documentary because of its way of filming , editing and overall story-telling , so the movie is more stuck somewhere between a mockumentary and just a subtle comedy . Not that this makes the movie any less fun to watch though . It's obvious director Christopher Guest tried to make his own " This Is Spinal Tap " , a movie and early fake documentary he was involved with previously as an actor , song writer , composer and writer . He also does all of those things in this movie by the way and then some more as well . It's obvious director and writer Christopher Guest let his actors do a whole lot of improvisation and gave them lots of room to play . At times he just lets the camera role and let the actors do their thing . They come up with with things at times as they just go along . Some of the actors handle this better than the others . I think this is because every actor is itself is very individualistic and want to do things their way , which is not always possible when the actors opposite you is having a monologue concerning the other actor opposite and all you can do is respond to it and just go along with the other actor . Some actors on the other do know how to handle this and go along perfectly with it , such as for instance Eugene Levy . Who must have really enjoyed his improvisations was Fred Willard , as the commentator of the big dog-show . Man , some of the stuff he says is absolute great and hilarious . The characters and the sort of not everyday and sort of odd background story of a dog-show is what makes this movie work and fun to watch . It's a real subtle sort of comedy that doesn't try to be funny in a forced way but let the actors and characters be the center of the movie its comedy instead , without trying to make them look too funny and more real and humane like , despite all of their oddness's . It's a fun in-between movie to watch , just like this was a fun in-between movie to make for the actors involved I'll bet .
518848	8239592	178050	9.0	An unjustly overlooked slice of the 70's rock sleeper	In the late 90's and early 00's there was a rash of terrifically lively and affectionate rock films centering on a specific aspect of 70's rock'n'roll : Among these pictures are the wonderfully raucous teen romp " Detroit Rock City , " the marvelous glam rock epic " Velvet Goldmine , " Cameron Crowe's sweetly autobiographical " Almost Famous , " and this undeservedly overlooked low-key winner about six young hopefuls in lowdown funky , free'n'easy , anything-goes carefree hedonistic 70's Los Angeles who are desperately trying to make it in the music business on the glitzy Sunset Strip , the much-fabled boulevard of starry-eyed dreams and glittery glamour . In a highly busy and eventful single day the lives of cocky , strutting , long-haired singer Jared Leto , scrawny , scruffy , wide-eyed guitarist Nick Stahl , obnoxious coke-snorting hipster Adam Goldberg , moody songwriter Rory Cochrane , eager struggling costume designer Anna Friel , and mellow photographer Simon Baker are radically changed forever as they meet with either hard-earned success or dismal crashing failure during the course of a crucially important 24 hour period . Adam Collis ' assured , observant , naturalistic no-frills direction relates the hoppin ' narrative at a deliberately gradual pace , offering a totally convincing , lovingly detailed , and admirably unromanticized recreation of an especially raw and exciting era . Better still , the seedier aspects of the backstage rock world - - drugs , groupies , venereal diseases and so on - - are depicted with a certain fierce honesty and engaging matter-of-factness . The precisely written script by Randall Jahnson and Russell DeGrazier keeps the plot on track from start to finish , never letting the colorful series of episodic vignettes degenerate into a rambling and unfocused mess . The top-rate soundtrack of choice vintage tunes galvanizes the proceedings with tremendous crackling verve while the gaudy fashions and embarrassing hairstyles perfectly peg the gloriously tacky and outrageous excesses of the notoriously loose and libertine Me Decade . Kudos also to Ron Fortunato's handsome , sparkling cinematography and Stewart Copeland's right-on groovy score . And the fresh cast of immensely attractive and appealing young thespians all give excellent performances : Friel in particular invests her role with an irresistibly perky aplomb and Leto ( Ellen Burstyn's useless ineffectual junkie son in the gut-wrenching " Requiem for A Dream " ) projects an arrogant swagger that's completely smack dead on target . Veteran character actor John Randolph has a lovely part as a crusty , but kindly elderly landlord . An unjustly neglected sleeper that's eminently worthy of rediscovery and subsequent possible cult status .
548776	1111192	95956	4.0	The same , but then again not the same . . . all in all though the weakest of the Rambo movies I have seen .	I have yet to see the fourth entry into the First Blood / Rambo series , but of the three I have seen this is by far the weakest . I had to watch this movie in two sittings cause for me it was just hard to sit through . I do not know why this one kind of bores me , it has action and a cool scene involving gunpowder , it just sort of still disappoints to a high degree . Rambo is once again approached by Trautman to accompany him on a mission to I think Afghanistan . Rambo declines probably tired after the strange fight he has that would later be spoofed in the rather humorous film " Hot Shots part Deus " . Well Trautman is caught by those mean , evil Russians while trying to help the poor , good natured Afghans ( of course , I think if we knew then what we know now we would have been pulling for the Russians ) . So off Rambo goes , to save his buddy from the clutches of the Russians . Along the way he plays a stupid game and rides a horse which for some reason strikes me as very unRambolike . You have the fight aboard a helicopter which along with the gunpowder scene are probably the best in the film . I also liked it when he was crawling on his belly and using his knife to find mines . Besides that though this movie is almost unwatchable as the set up is familiar , but then it is not . I just think this movie was not well thought out and executed a bit more poorly than the other two Rambo's .
514848	317399	1069238	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Departures	By now almost everyone would have heard of this Japanese film Okuribito ( Departures ) , given its win in the recent Academy Awards , clinching the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film , beating the likes of crowd favourite Waltzing With Bashir , and the Palme D'or winner The Class . And now after watching it , it's no surprise really , because if I were to go tongue in cheek , it's the novelty factor , given that the Academy would never have conceived upon the notion that a film coming from Asia and filled with death , corpses and coffins , would be anything but a horror film . Seriously though , Departures have Awards written all over it , with fine acting complementing a strong story to tell . I suppose the equivalent of a " casketer " in local context , would be the embalmer . And it's without a doubt a profession most misunderstood , and shunned because of our innate fear of death . We choose to avoid death where it had gone , and being an embalmer would unlikely be on any kid's wish list of professions . Despite the stereotypical negative connotations , it is a profession that is quite dignified , because the professional is entrusted with the responsibility of helping the loved ones of the deceased cope with the passing on , and to help ease the pain in bringing some colour before the final journey to either the burial ground , or crematorium . Departures demystifies this profession in the Japanese context . And like all things Japanese , the process comes with an elaborate ritual of preparation , cleansing and presentation , all done with great precision , skillful grace and utmost respect for both the deceased , and the family members . The profession depicted here in the film , is one of the highest order , where we see exactly how the casketers go about their job , and the separation of duties with the undertaker . Masahiro Motoki ( last seen in The Longest Night in Shanghai ) stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi , a cellist in an orchestra who dreams of going places around the world with his wife Mika ( Ryoko Hirosue ) in tow . Unfortunately for him , his orchestra folds and he is forced to sell his expensive white elephant since he doubts he could make his passion into a successful career . Dejected , he convinces his wife to retreat back into the small town he came from , living in the house his late mother had left behind , in order to start a new life . Little did he know when responding to a job classifieds that a typo had given him the impression he would be in a career that involves travel . The boss of the shop Ikuei Sasaki ( Tsutomu Yamazaki ) hires him on instinct , and as the saying goes , the rest is history . For the curious , the film is an excellent medium to showcase the profession and to do so in good light . We come to learn the craft behind the job , and the necessity of it all , be it dealing with grieving family members , or taking care of bodies that are bound for autopsies . Departures paints through Daigo's experience , the varying spectrum of emotions that one as a service provider would have to face , as we journey with him from novice level . All's not doom and gloom of course , as director Yujiro Takita paced the film with well meaning humour ? again never slapstick or disrespectful ? throughout the narrative . The story by Kundo Koyama also excellently portrayed Daigo's relationships with his wife and with his mentor , where the former was like a rubber band waiting to snap because of Daigo's deliberate attempts to not tell his lovely wife what he's up to for a career in order to shield her from the taboo . With the latter from whom he picks up the tools of the trade from , there's a surrogate father figure which he never had while growing up , resulting in some pent up hatred toward his dad who walked out on the family when he was young . It's an extremely moving piece of drama that doesn't get bogged down by melodrama , and I thoroughly enjoyed its themes of reconciliation , forgiveness and best of all , being a professional and serving with pride . It's a fantastically crafted film with an excellent cast all round , and shatters all taboos that come with the profession of a " casketer " . I know it's cliché to say this , but Departures will be a strong contender when I compile my list of top films for the year . It's been some time already where I'm equally entertained and moved by a film , and without a doubt , do not let this depart from our local cinemas before you get a chance to watch it on the big screen . Highly recommended !
492810	3280905	43955	7.0	Against All Comers	THE RACKET is not a great film noir , but it is an interesting variant on the typical formula . In normal film noir , the central figure is isolated - he or she is struggling to survive a secret enemy or to prove his or her innocence of a capital crime charge . Think of Ray Milland in THE BIG CLOCK . Think of Bogart in THE MALTESE FALCON or Alan Ladd in THE BLUE DAHLIA . But here that central figure is hardly sympathetic . Robert Ryan is Nick Scanlon . He is an old fashioned criminal boss - a Capone , if you will , rather than say a Frank Costello . Capone chewed up all his enemies to make himself boss of Chicago . Costello could order violence too , but he preferred modern business methods . Although he had his prison periods , at the end of his life he was a highly respected criminal chairman of the board type ( he enjoyed it when he entered a party or dinner of his cronies , and the band would strike up the theme from THE GODFATHER ) . Although Capone was to be involved in the formation of the national syndicate , he ended up in Alcatraz , and then went insane from syphilis . Scanlon has never sought favors from anyone - he is his own law . He tells crooked politicians ( like Ray Collins here ) what they have to do . And Collins keeps warning Lt . McQuigg ( Robert Mitchum ) to lay off or go easy on Scanlon . But McQuigg has other ideas . So does an unseen figure we hear of called " The Old Man " . His representative is Don Porter , and Porter is explaining to the crime bosses of the area that " The Old Man " does have a specific plan of operations that is more in line with the Costello model than the Capone one . Everyone will be taken care of , and modern corporate technique will replace the tommy gun and dynamite bomb . But " The Old Man " and Porter do not reckon with one snarly critic : Ryan . He is not interested in falling into line for anyone . Who is " The Old Man " anyway ? So Ryan , by his personality and violent nature finds that the authorities represented by Mitchum are pushing in on one side , and the modern criminal syndicate ( represented by Porter ) is pushing in on the other side . And starting with that problem he decides that if they want a fight ( and " they " means all comers ) they'll get it . Capone might have approved - so would have Tony Carmonte in SCARFACE . The situation is worsened by the activities of William Talman , one of Mitchum's best junior officers , who keeps thwarting Ryan's schemes , and inflicts damage on him . Ryan's answer is to mark Talman for destruction , no matter how this worsens the situations with Mitchum and with Porter . As you can see this is an interesting situation . As an interesting enough film noir it is a " 7 " out of " 10 " . A bit more character development of Ryan's kingpin might have raised a bit in the film noir pantheon , but ( sadly ) that was not done here . Worth watching but not as good as it could have been .
366249	3109237	26663	10.0	" I have conquered science ! Why can't I conquer love ? "	Renowned surgeon Dr . Gogol ( Peter Lorre ) is madly obsessed with an actress named Yvonne Orlac . The feeling , however , is not mutual as Yvonne is married to a pianist named Stephen . When Stephen's gifted and talented hands are crushed in a train wreck , Yvonne begrudgingly seeks Gogol's assistance to save her husband's career . Seeing an opportunity to get in Yvonne's good graces , he agrees to help Stephen . Gogol replaces Stephen's mangled hands with those of a knife throwing murderer only recently put to death . But Gogol's plans for Yvonne backfire when Stephen's new hands prove to have a mind of their own . Overlooked for far too long ( probably because it wasn't part of the Universal packages that so many television stations bought and aired ) , it's good to finally see Mad Love getting so much richly deserved praise . It's a classic in every sense of the word . There are so many facets to the movie I could write about , but , in the name of brevity , I'll try to control myself and limit my comments to two items . The first is the film's look . Technically , Mad Love is nothing short of brilliant . Director Karl Freund was first and foremost a cinematographer ? as Mad Love proves . Freund knew how to shoot a scene . As an example , take a look at the scenes set in the hallway and stairwell of Dr . Gogol's house . They may be insignificant to the overall movie , but you can see the care and effort Freund put into those moments . These scenes are like a painting come to life with their stunningly beautiful mix of light and shadows . Or , take the better known shots of Gogol dressed as the dead knife thrower . Not only are the special effects some of the most frightening of the 30s , the lighting in that scene goes a long way to creating the desired effect . It's an amazing piece of work . Peter Lorre's performance is the other aspect of Mad Love that jumps out at me . Lorre has always been a favorite of mine , but I consider his work in Mad Love the best he ever did . Lorre does more without words in this movie than most actors would be capable of . For example , Gogol's repressed longing for Yvonne is clearly evident on Lorre's face without him even having to utter a word . Or , take the scenes in the operating room . The slow building madness in Lorre's eyes as the surgery progresses is clearly evident . And once again , Lorre doesn't have to utter a word . I consider Lorre's performance in Mad Love to be one of the best in the annals of horror . Brilliant ! And I don't know who came up with the idea of the shaved head to go along with Lorre's bulging eyes , but it was a winner . It only serves to highlight Lorre's already expressive features . As I indicated previously , if I allowed myself I could write for days on Mad Love . But I won't . I suppose I could end this by mentioning what has to be the most common criticism of Mad Love that I've read ? the comic relief . But why let something that insignificant ruin what is otherwise a perfect movie ?
438277	306861	272944	10.0	Silliness At Sea	A Warner Brothers Vitaphone Short Subject . With music provided by Roger Wolfe Kahn & His Orchestra , THE YACHT PARTY provides some snappy music for a few idle rich guests . Without enough plot to hang a yachtsman's hat on , this short film is simply an excuse for a few minutes of silly songs . Highlights are comic singer Gertrude Niesen's impersonation of Lyda Roberti and incredibly double-jointed Melissa Mason performing a solo dance in which she does things with her legs which scarcely seem human . Rich kid Kahn produces some enjoyable music ; the final moments , in which he supposedly conducts his orchestra from a biplane , presages his eventual career change to airplane design & testing . Music mavens will spot an unbilled Artie Shaw playing the clarinet . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
494662	342623	59263	7.0	Based on a true story of the Norwegian resistance	" The Heroes of Telemark " is a 1965 film telling the story of the great bravery of people in the Norwegian resistance during World War II as they attempt to keep material for the atom bomb out of the hands of the Nazis . It stars Kirk Douglas , Richard Harris , Michael Redgrave and Ulla Jacobsen . This is a strange film for several reasons . It has some tremendous people in it yet they aren't really used effectively , i . e . , Michael Redgrave and Ulla Jacobsen as examples , gorgeous scenery and skiing sequences that aren't particularly well photographed ; and a story that includes inaccuracies rather than the true facts . Certainly one can understand the need to combine characters or cut out segments of a story , but when the actual event is as thrilling as the real story of Telemark , why change it ? Several people have commented , as usual , about actors having no accents , most especially Kirk Douglas as a Norwegian scientist . In films , it's more difficult to keep to the theatrical convention , but nevertheless , it is correct : When a film takes place in another country and characters from and in that country are speaking , they ARE NOT SPEAKING English . They are speaking German , Norwegian , whatever . So the convention is - NO ACCENT . Why would Norwegians be in Norway speaking to other Norwegians in English ? Why would they be speaking English to Germans ? They wouldn't be . A good example is the film " The Mortal Storm . " It takes place in Germany , and Margaret Sullavan , James Stewart , and Robert Young speak with no accents . CORRECT . The problem in Hollywood is that they cast some people who are American and some people who are from other countries , making the accent situation difficult . Be that as it may , Kirk Douglas did not need an accent and it was correct that he did not have one . And he can't slip in and out of one - speak with an accent when in England , for instance , because that would be ridiculous . Despite the fact that this film has its drawbacks , it is nevertheless good , with some exciting sequences . It just wasn't very well directed by Anthony Mann , who makes the pace too leisurely . It would have been a better film with more attention to the true facts , a little more characterization , and a faster pace .
493952	342623	386676	5.0	I have a feeling the British version is better . . . much better	I probably should give this show more of a chance , but I was so incredibly uncomfortable during it , I probably won't watch it again . Most of the time , British comedies , when taken over by Americans , don't seem to make it . " Fawlty Towers , " which lasted all of five minutes , comes to mind . This appears to be one of them . There were some very funny moments , and I suspect they were taken right out of the British version . The boss , plain and simple , is a complete moron . Totally out of it , he thinks he's a role model and hilariously funny , when all the while he's a sexual harasser who makes racist remarks , does Three Stooges impressions , and is emotionally abusive ( firing his secretary for stealing as a practical joke and bringing her to tears ) . It's a great setup for a fabulous character , but I found him only annoying . I'm afraid my attitude is closest to that of the temp's : embarrassed , appalled , and not finding much funny .
437463	306861	54634	10.0	A Documented Case	A Walt Disney GOOFY Cartoon . Although happily suffering from AQUAMANIA , ' Mr . X ' ( Goofy ) is about to enter the water for the scariest experience of his life . . . This little film is a friendly poke in the ribs of anyone who's ever been consumed with water sports . The quality of the animation is not up to the standard of the classics of earlier decades , but the story is whimsical & amusing . Both Goofy , Jr and the terrified Octopus add to the fun . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

But come on , I wanted a good laugh mixed in with a few scares . I mean , despite it's non-promising Oscar material screen play , come on , this was so much fun to watch . The great thing about it , was that it didn't take itself so seriously . I'll admit it , I love the Leprechaun movies . I mean , they're so bad that they're good . They have a great amount of laughs and so does this one . I know I'm going to miss Leprechaun in Space , unfortunately I can't find it , but I'll stick with the Hood . As silly as it sounds , the plot is about these wanna be rappers who take a flute from Ice-T who stole it from the Leprechaun . The flute has magical powers to make them famous , so not only is Ice-T trying to get it back , but so is the leprechaun . With a scary scene of Warwick rapping , this was a fun movie to watch .
468745	1532177	106452	6.0	Somewhat Unnecessary	Everyone knows the plot of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS because they'd already been two adaptations before the 1993 remake . The same basic plot had also been done in the 1955 television serial QUATERMASS 2 which was also remade by Hammer films in the late 1950s and we've seen DOCTOR WHO stories like Spearhead From Space that uses a very similar premise . In short the idea had been done to death by the 1990s On its own BODY SNATCHERS isn't a terrible film , it is moody and dark as it should be , but it does have a rather mechanical script with a scene featuring some teen angst followed by a mysterious scene followed by a scene featuring teen angst followed by a mysterious scene followed by a scene featuring teen angst . Everyone knows that the plot revolves around alien infiltration so do the audience get to find out why the aliens come to Earth ? Not really , unlike the 50s original there's no real ambiguity as to the aliens motive or subtext either . I should also point out that aliens taking over military bases makes perfect logical sense if they want to nullify humanity but unfortunately setting the story on a military base where through necessity human individuality is disallowed and where the newly introduced protagonists don't know the other characters means we have a story that lacks compelling and terrifying drama . We find it somewhat difficult to care about the people involved because they lack individuality to begin with . As I said it's by no means terrible but BODY SNATCHERS fails alongside the 1978 version which I rate as the greatest paranoid thriller ever made
585229	1219578	120784	3.0	nothing to eat in this reheated menu	" Payback " sadly confirms this trend : scenarists don't often make worthwhile movies . I'm amazed when I see the crop of plaudits the film garnered when it opened the streets at the dawn of 1999 in France . The specialized press liked the cleansing vibe which revived this thriller as well as its stylish aesthetic side . I'm not conducive at all to these assets and it seems that we didn't watch the same movie . I only saw a derivative story that piled up well-worn ingredients revolving around a story of revenge with an obstinate , unscrupulous killer , Porter ( Mel Gibson ) who wants to have his cash back and is confronted to a gallery of stereotyped characters including a sadomasochistic mistress , ruthless business men , baddies and members of the underworld . Brian Helgeland searched this way and that ( Quentin Tarantino's universe , the " Dirty Harry " saga , many gangster movies ) to bestow his film with a semblance of substance . But his scenario can't hold up because it seems to have been written in a snap manner and it's too linear to be really excited about it in spite of the unexpected twists and turns to beef it up . Anyway , some of these turns aren't that much fresh . His directing also accumulates free violence with many fights , scraps , explosions thrown in for good measure and to give substance to a skimpy , ramshackle set . But beyond the endeavor to give a stylish film which makes it look like a comic strip , there's really nothing exciting . Mel Gibson acts like a dogged zombie and gets the lion's share in the cast . He was at odds with Helgeland and reorganized several moments as well as he supervised the editing . He beat a dead horse for it doesn't improve the quality of the film .
469576	1532177	94678	4.0	Annoying Little Man In An Annoying Little Film	There's an early scene in ARTHUR 2 ON THE ROCKS that sums up this movie . It's the scene where Arthur taps on a fellow millionaires car window to be told " You're an annoying little man " . Couldn't have said it better myself sir . Annoying , that's the word and that's the whole film - Annoying Some people may say that's the whole point of Arthur Bach , he's supposed to be annoying and I'm not disputing any of this , my beef is not the way that he's written but by the irritating manner he's played by Dudley Moore who also executively produced ( Usually the sign of a bad movie when the executive producer and star are the same person ) this unentertaining sequel . Moore plays Arthur to the hilt and goes way over the top and never missing an opportunity to tell the audience that this guy's a drunk who thinks he's funny , and there's nothing less funny than someone who thinks he is . Portraying a drunken character is never easy at the best of times and Moore totally fails in his attempts He's not helped by the script though which has one of those premises that has a good idea but doesn't seem to be well developed at all : Arthur and his wife are trying to adopt a baby after falling upon hard times so Arthur must stop drinking and get a job . It's the kind of idea that personifies good drama of the main protagonist being split between need and desire ie Arthur must needs to stop drinking in order to achieve a better life but he desires to carry on drinking . Unfortunately the drama never really surfaces and the audience are mistreated to numerous scenes of Arthur telling unfunny jokes to the people he meets which doesn't make for a good film
576585	1399158	56404	6.0	LOVE ON A PILLOW ( Roger Vadim , 1962 )	While their short-lived marriage was long gone , this is the fourth of five Roger Vadim / Brigitte Bardot collaborations and only the second I've watched myself . After opening in a light comedy vein , this rather scrappy film turns into an unappetizingly ponderous melodrama on the lines of LA DOLCE VITA ( 1960 ) , complete with a risibly " beat " orgy sequence and a surfeit of pretentious chat ; nevertheless , the whole is somewhat redeemed by the attractive Italian locations in its second half and the nice musical score throughout . For what it's worth , it tells of a bourgeois girl ( Bardot ) ? shortly to be married to an unassuming young man ? travelling from Paris to Dijon to hear the will of her late aunt , who accidentally stumbles on the suicide attempt of a bohemian , pulp-thriller-loving misanthrope ( Robert Hossein ) who , upon recovering , literally turns her life upside down . The cast is completed by James Robertson Justice ( as Hossein's sculptor friend ) , Macha Meril ( as Robertson's tramp companion ) and , in one sequence , Michel Serrault as a notary . In the end , the original title of THE WARRIOR'S REST sounds far more interesting that what's on offer here and the fact that I was misinformed about the film's running time ? I thought it was a good 22 minutes shorter ! ? did not help to earn it much affection from my end . But , then , the sight of Bardot in her prime ( and , Vadim being Vadim , in various stages of undress as well ) is always welcome . . .
438571	1617546	320534	4.0	Primitive for 1913	This trick slapstick comedy - - surviving in a print in the Dutch film archives under a title that translates as ' The Slapstick Police Agent ' is primitive by the standards of 1913 , as objects appear , disappear and change into other objects in a very simple fashion , although the mail box that follows the cop is amusing . The lead character , a short , tubby fellow who reminds me of Lew Costello in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE KEYSTONE COPS takes his falls competently , including one extreme neck roll that has him standing on his head for an instant . But slapstick had already moved beyond this stage elsewhere , into bone-breaking stuff in Italy and Keystone antics in the US . Worth seeing once , perhaps , for completists .

450031	2093818	203667	8.0	Nice look on the making of The Shining	This is what Making Of DVD extras are supposed to be like ( or , at the very least , should be like ) : short , precise and to the point . Vivian Kubrick , the directors daughter , takes a camera and follows Nicholson around and interviews some of the actors , both during and after production about making the film and their opinion of Stanley Kubrick . Jack Nicholson was entertaining to watch , because though his characters are usually a lot like himself , it's kind of a rarity to see him really be himself . He flirts a little with Vivian , which must be considered either somewhat cute or deeply disturbing , seeing as he's old enough to be her father , and her actual father is nearby . Danny Lloyd is kind of cute to see interviewed . Shelley Duvall is interesting to listen to in the interviews . Scatman Crothers ' interview is inspirational , even though it only lasts a few seconds . Nicholson is the most interesting and gets the most time in this . What I really liked about it , though , what really made it interesting to me was seeing Kubrick work . He has a certain intensity , a concentration that I find inspirational and impressive , being a ( albeit on a much smaller scale ) film-maker myself . Seeing him directing , figuring out angles , and just going around between takes . . . you can feel his intensity and concentration all the way through . I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or film-making in general . While not very technical , it provides a good look at what goes on behind the scenes on a film production .

This is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex . There's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment . Also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports . . . Sounds promising ? Not really . I became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film . Basically I started not watching , which made events seem even more surreal when I did look up . It may work for you , it didn't for me .

This is an exceptionally funny cartoon , in spots , but it will never see print , for many reasons , not the least of which is the fact that it uses what are commonly referred to as " racial stereotypes " . Never mind the fact that the title character is for all practical purposes , Bluto with a headdress and no beard . There is a hilarious line by Popeye that makes no sense if you have no knowledge of an old-time radio show popular in the 1930s nd a visual gag that calls to mind the more surreal days when literally anything could happen in a Fleischer cartoon ! Very good short ! Catch it if you can ! Recommended .
365179	4888011	52738	10.0	diaries always make for something great	Telling the story of the German-Jewish girl whose diary brought memories of the Third Reich into people's homes worldwide , " The Diary of Anne Frank " haunts you like few other movies . As the titular character , Millie Perkins creates someone who - despite her horrific experiences - remains convinced that human nature is good . Probably the two most harrowing scenes in the movie are when everyone listens to Hitler on the radio , and when Anne faints while someone walks up the stairs . All in all , this is a great movie . Equally as good as Perkins are Joseph Schildkraut as Anne's father Otto , who will stop at nothing to protect his family ; Shelley Winters ( who won Best Supporting Actress ) as Petronella Van Daan , the matriarch of the family hiding with them ; and Richard Beymer - who played Tony in " West Side Story " - as Peter Van Daan , with whom Anne develops a relationship . Also starring are Gusti Huber , Lou Jacobi , Diane Baker , Douglas Spencer , Dodie Heath and Ed Wynn . A masterpiece .

He wants to give a medal to an old war buddy's father ( who saved his life ) . I was a little confused by this backstory ; I wondered why everyone didn't just tell Mr . Tracy his friend's father passed away . Now , that I think about it , I'm sure the filmmakers must have wanted us to think Tracy's character was much younger . That , and one of Tracy's almost super-human feats , are the film's major flaws . Otherwise , it's great . Tracy's performance carried the film - he is an immediate visual intrusion on this old western-style town ; instead of western gear , he wears a regular suit . Although it's a dark suit , Tracy's performance relays the fact that he is the " good guy " . John Sturges does an excellent job directing ; I've seen the Sturges credit on a number of films , and believe this may be his best . Robert Ryan and the citizens of Black Rock work very well indeed with Sturges and Tracy . This is a film I'm looking forward to seeing again .

577163	1399158	56358	6.0	PONTIUS PILATE ( Irving Rapper and Gian Paolo Callegari , 1962 )	Best-known for a string of Bette Davis tear-jerkers , director Rapper had previously overseen another Italian Biblical epic , Joseph AND HIS BRETHREN ( 1960 ) , but he would subsequently direct just two more movies in Hollywood . Despite a general air of overfamiliarity to the proceedings , the film is quite watchable as it unveils ? and only falls apart in its last third , when the Jesus trials take center-stage . This is because the figure of Jesus had only been mentioned fleetingly before ( even by the Pharisees ) and suddenly the whole of Judea turns against him for no apparent reason ( other than , it seems , because that's what did happen according to the Bible ) ! In fact , before this unconvincing about-face , the figure of High Priest Caiaphas ( Basil Rathbone ) was a sympathetic one fighting with dignity for the plight of his oppressed people . Another uncharacteristic event is the fact that , according to this version , it is Judas ( John Drew Barrymore ) who convinces the Pharisees that Jesus is dangerous , and it is they alone who capture him at Gethsemane ! ! Whatever the flaws in the many-handed script ( seven writers in total ! ) , they are redeemed by competent production values and a good cast : Jean Marais ( rather stiff in the title role ) , Jeanne Crain ( as Pilate's wife ) , Leticia Roman ( a Judean girl Pilate falls for ) , Roger Treville ( as Roman's powerful merchant father ) , Massimo Serato ( as Nicodemus ) , Riccardo Garrone ( as Pilate's faithful lieutenant ) , Gianni Garko ( as one of a bald-headed [ ! ] Barabbas ' rebels ) and Raffaella Carra ' ( as Garko's girl ) ; according to the IMDb , Paul Muller and Dante Di Paolo also appear but , personally , I didn't recognize them ! Interestingly enough , the events unfold in flashback at Pilate's own trial before an uncredited Emperor Caligula . . . with the former using the same silent tactics ( and , subsequently , the famous words ) as Christ himself did before him ! !
418450	1609079	1053058	7.0	" A Paper of Pins " : Greer Garson guys herself .	I was living in Britain and Australia when ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' aired in the States , so I didn't have a chance to watch it regularly . I'm aware of the controversies which accompanied this programme , and which only make me that much keener to track down all the episodes . Despite the ' Comedy Hour ' title , this was actually a variety series featuring impressive guest performances by some major music acts across a wide range of musical styles and genres . This synopsis is specifically a review of the fifth episode of the 2nd series of ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' , one of the few episodes which I've seen . The musical guests in this episode are cried the Association . . . and where did they come up with THAT strange name ? I've heard several of the Association's performances ; I've never enjoyed their close-harmony arrangements , and I tend to dissociate myself from the Association . I can't even remember what song ( s ) they perform here , and that's no loss . ' Mister Patrick Leighton Paulsen ' ( as Dick Smothers introduces him ) does one of his usual unfunny ' editorials ' . I've never found Paulsen funny : he was a deeply angry man who didn't even bother memorising his material ; he relied heavily on cue cards , and towards the end of his life he got increasingly lazy at hiding this penchant . Far and away , the real delight of this episode is a rare guest appearance by the actress Greer Garson , still gorgeous and classy several years after her film career waned . She and Dick duet here on ' A Paper of Pins ' , a beautifully understated English folk-song . Just occasionally , the Smothers Brothers would put aside their political agenda to return to their roots as folk singers . . . by which I mean performers of authentic folk minstrelsy , rather than that hippy-dippy coffee-house stuff . Garson's singing voice is splendid here , and she's very beautiful . When Dick Smothers ( an underrated actor ) sings to her the song's simple lyric - - " I'll give to you a paper of pins , and that's the way my love begins " - - it's easy to imagine that he's genuinely courting her . There has long been a very nasty urban legend about Garson that I'd love to put to rest . Supposedly , when she won her Oscar for ' Mrs Miniver ' , Garson gave a very long boring acceptance speech . Here's the truth : shortly after Garson's Oscar win , gay actor Laird Cregar attended a gay party in Hollywood at which he performed a vicious parody of Garson , giving a long-winded and pompous parody of her speech . Somehow this came to be perceived as the fact . On the very rare occasions when Greer Garson ever discussed the incident , she made plain that she resented the inaccurate rumour . In light of the above , I was astounded by a comedy bit which Garson performs in this Smothers Brothers episode . In the second half of the show , the Smothers siblings and their resident repertory company ( without Garson ) perform a series of skits . Alternating with these , Garson stands at a podium and gives a very long-winded parody of her own Academy Award speech ! I found it deeply surprising that she would do this , since she must have realised that this skit would lend credence to the same rumour that she'd previously disavowed . Well , at least this shows that Garson could make fun of herself . What a classy lady ! My rating of this episode : , mostly for Garson's participation .
563913	102816	93428	6.0	Alright , hold on tight now . It's down , down to the wire !	The first of Dalton's double-bill as 007 is a merely above-average affair . The one thing that really stops TLD from being a better film is the fact that it's just too tame . This was the last Bond film to be given a PG rating as it was clear that they couldn't appeal to the family audience any longer . With a new Bond should have come a new approach . Yes , it does feel more modern and realistic but since the script was originally designed for Moore they missed a chance at taking advantage of Bond's dark side . Thankfully , they did exactly that in Licence to Kill . Ian Fleming's story had Bond on a sniping mission , detailing every characteristic and moment of his assignment . Upon spotting the person he's been ordered to kill he discovers it's a beautiful woman and chooses to wound her instead of killing her . Wishing M to fire him for disobeying orders he comments that he must have ' scared the living daylights out of her ' . The story ended on this note . The film expands this premise and has Bond escort a defecting Soviet agent from Russia only to disbelieve his story of a Russian General going berserk . Upon investigating further he discovers a plot involving the Mujhadeen and an American Arms dealer . Despite these complications and developments , there's just not enough killing ! Without meaning to sound bloodthirsty , I just think that Bond should have laid waste to more bad guys . The script doesn't really give him a chance to . And , as a result , the film seems watered-down and too broad . Director John Glen stages and frames the action very well , as always but it's John Barry's score ( his last involvement with the series ) that gives it that extra punch . The Bond theme , so incredibly worn-out and done-to-death , is given a new spin , a faster tempo and more modern feel . Despite being about nine when I first saw it , this is the first thing I realized . They ruined a lot of potential by not taking this renewing further and not giving us a tougher film . Of Dalton's reign as 007 , Licence to Kill is definitely the superior film , but don't rule-out Living Daylights . Average it may be , but still far from being anywhere near bad .

" Back to the Future " solidified Michael J . Fox as a bona fide movie star , and featured a deliriously wacky Christopher Lloyd playing a scientist who invents a time travel machine . Robert Zemeckis keeps things light and playful - - he's one of many directors ( like Ron Howard , Steven Spielberg , etc . ) who started out making enjoyable romps until he felt the need to become " serious " and started making movie crap like " Forrest Gump .

This film can still stand on its own however as good entertainment . As in The Grestest Show On Earth , someone is out trying to sabotage the circus . The villain here isn't doing it for some nefarious scheme to enrich , it's a very psychologically disturbed individual who is not unmasked until the very end . The leads here are Victor Mature in the role of circus boss and he's got financial troubles . Working to help straighten out the circus's finances are Rhonda Fleming and Red Buttons . Both aren't quite used to the culture of the circus , but Vic works the old heavy lidded charm and he's got a sister in Kathryn Crosby who brings the circus out in banker Buttons . In The Greatest Show on Earth James Stewart took a supporting role as a clown because he always wanted to play one . Peter Lorre departs from his usual villainy to play a similar kind of clown , kind of a father confessor to the show . But my favorite in the film is Gilbert Roland . He plays the patriarch of a high wire act and the high point of the film is his walk across Niagara Falls as a publicity stunt for the financially strapped show . Roland is under a lot of pressure , his wife , Adele Mara , having been the only fatality in a planned train wreck . In fact The Big Circus took so much from The Greatest Show on Earth like the train wreck and other things that producer / director Irwin Allen was rightly criticized for a lack of originality . It seems he was just trying he could do the same things on the screen better than DeMille . Nevertheless The Big Circus is a fine film on its own , entertaining and colorful for children of all ages .
512729	3223254	388118	6.0	Good Performances by Attractive Actors Fail to Breathe Life into this Tale	THE WHORE'S SON ( ' Hurensohn ' ) , based on a novel by Gabriel Loidolt and translated to the screen by Michael Glawogger is an interesting premise for a film - how does a child learn to accept the fact that his mother is a prostitute ? The problem with the cinematic translation under Michael Sturminger's direction is that the tale becomes a one-note song . The ingredients seem to be right - gorgeous photography , beautiful actors - but the possibilities are simply never realized . Covering a period of about fourteen or so years the film introduces Silvija ( the very beautiful and fragile appearing Chulpan Khamatova ) , a Croatian refugee in Germany who throws out her abusive boyfriend who is the father of her infant son Ozren and strikes out on her own . Her only way to make ends meet is through prostitution , and while she adores her son , she by necessity must leave him with his Aunt Ljiljana ( Ina Gogalova ) while she plies her trade . The film follows the growth of the boy to his early teens when his role is played by the very sensitive , charismatic actor Stanislav Lisnic . Ozren is convinced that his mother is a waitress , until his friends and adults in the neighborhood ( including fellow hookers ) force him to realize Silvija's true profession . Silvija manages to provide Ozren with the basics of life - clothes , food , shelter , and love - and Ozren responds to her with unconditional love : even when he accepts the fact that Silvija is a prostitute he maintains his adoration ( is it beyond that ? ? ? ) for her . There are sidebars that mix Yugoslavian politics with the plight of the immigrants in a foreign adopted land and there is a superficial relationship between Ozren and a classmate that seems to go nowhere . In the end we are essentially where we started : a son loves his mother despite her profession and her personality defects . The film is a pleasure to view because of the excellent camera work by cinematographer Jürgen Jürges , an apt musical score by Adrian Vonwiller , and actors are all strong , especially Stanislav Lisnic and Chulpan Khamatova . The story outline has potential . It is a shame that potential got lost in the production values . Grady Harp
428466	3079504	74356	6.0	Story of a Bigfoot like monster on the loose is best watched at night with the lights out	Two college students from Chicago decide to investigate the stories of a Bigfoot-like creature in the area around Black Lake Louisiana . Once there they find that no one wants to talk to them about the creature . However they begin to make friends who open up with tales of the creature . They end up in a battle for their lives when the creature comes after them . Drive-in fare from the 1970's is much better than its reputation would suggest . While certainly not the scariest movie ever made it does have its share of chills as the little seen monster causes mayhem to those who stray with in its grasp . I don't know what my reaction would have been had I seen this is a drive-in back in ' 76 and then driven home in the rural south . My guess is I would be dreading hearing the creepy cry of the creature ( a cry I know my brothers would have loved to imitate to scare anyone who saw the film ) . Definitely worth a look for those who don't need their horror films to be slick modern productions . ( And recommended for a dark and stormy night with the lights out ) 6 . ( 6 for IMDb purposes )
401286	7743887	1164707	10.0	Surviving " Survivors "	After enduring the latest episode of B . B . C . - 1's ' Survivors ' , I watched this excellent half-hour documentary about the original show . More drama was to be found in the clips here than has so far been evident in Adrian Hodges ' hodge-podge . The opening episode - ' The Fourth Horseman ' - is an object exercise in minimalist drama . It opens with Abby Grant ( Carolyn Seymour ) , a middle-class housewife , awaiting her husband's return ( Peter Bowles , in what was basically an extended cameo ) from London . News reports are claiming that people are succumbing to a deadly new plague . Civilization is gradually breaking down , and what few survivors are left are forced to band together , to live and work as a community . It was more believable because it was seen to happen gradually . Not the case in ' Survivors 2008 ' . No sooner had the opening titles faded than Mankind was gone . The original survivors were drawn from all walks of life , featuring a smattering of elderly people , whereas the new intake are young , good-looking and more interested in sex than staying alive ( A kick up the backside to ' The Radio Times ' writer who claimed that the original was about men in jeans sitting around kitchen tables , discussing crop rotation ) . Complaints about the show being far ' too middle-class ' are trivial . When I watched ' Survivors ' , I was too absorbed in the drama to notice anyone's class . Good though the documentary was , it had flaws . The somewhat sniffy commentary would have us all believe that ' 70's Britain was not a very nice place to live , blighted by strikes , food shortages , and petrol rationing . Is today any better though ? We have had the global financial crisis ( sorted out by a Labour Prime Minister . Who would have thought it ? ) with banks collapsing and the credit crunch causing long-established firms like ' Woolworths ' to go to the wall . Will the Noughties look like Utopia to future generations ? Surprisingly unmentioned was the dispute between Terry Nation and ' Avengers ' writer Brian Clemens , who claimed the show's idea was originally his . Producer Terence Dudley was a megalomaniac , driving Nation away after the first series and then ( unforgivably ) sacking Carolyn Seymour . The show never really recovered ( Dudley's behaviour also alienated Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis , creators of his earlier sci-fi hit ' Doomwatch ' ) . Despite the production difficulties , ' Survivors ' was a cracking show , being both well acted and intelligently written . I could not believe my eyes when characters in the new show were seen accessing the internet . In one stroke the series ' purpose - the depiction of a world where Man has to learn to get by without technology - was defeated . It would be akin to a remake of ' The Changes ' having ' Nicky Gore ' using a laptop after fleeing a deserted London . It was good to see Seymour , Lucy ' Jenny ' Fleming , and Ian ' Greg ' McCulloch talking about the show , and their characters . They were indeed a great team . You cared about them . Seymour's open admission of alcoholism was indeed shocking . Director Pennant Roberts also had some interesting things to say , such as how the show had been inspired by a bestselling book on self sufficiency ( the same one also inspired the sitcom ' The Good Life ' ! ) . As it ended , I was left wanting to see the original ' Survivors ' again . If only to wipe away the memory of Adrian Hodges ' lifeless and stilted ' reimagining ' .
381964	449021	257076	5.0	When the going gets tough ; the rough get rougher .	Raucous , explosive , predictable and close to being forgettable . The top LAPD brass wants to repair and polish a tarnished reputation by bringing back from retirement Sgt . " Hondo " Harrelson ( Samuel L . Jackson ) to hand pick a special S . W . A . T . team to take care of extremely dangerous situations . The last picked , but most impressive officer is Jim Street ( Colin Farrell ) whose swagger has put him in hot water with the powers that be . Also on the squad is Chris Sanchez ( Michelle Rodriguez ) who has already been turned down for S . W . A . T . duty just because she is female . She is one tough babe that can more than carry her share of the load . The team gets assigned to transfer the head of a notorious European crime cartel Alex Montel ( Oliver Martinez ) to a Federal lockup . He has just murdered his uncle , but is arrested for a missing tail light on his uncle's car . Hell breaks loose when Montel looks into a news camera and claims to give $100 million to anyone who can set him free . A routine transfer turns into an all out war fighting off several different factions greedy for the crime boss ' money . The twisting climax proves there can be a scumbag among collective honor . The special effects are entertaining and far better than the some times stupid dialogue . Farrell and Jackson more or less carry the movie ; not to over look the winsome Rodriguez . Also in the cast are : Jeremy Renner , Larry Poindexter , Josh Charles and rapper LL Cool J . Watch for Steve Forrest who played " Hondo " Harrelson in the mid 70s TV series . He has a small role as a S . W . A . T . truck driver . I seriously doubt this movie causing any change in anyone's view of the LAPD .
409602	2567136	87003	7.0	. . . by any other name . . .	. . . this rose would smell . Smell as sweet ? Smell as hokey ? Smell of desperation ? Probably a little of each . The opening is masterful , a group of agents kibitzing in a down-market Lindy's and gradually homing in on one of their own kind , Danny Rose . At this stage the film opens out to cover a self-contained episode in Rose's career and I for one would have preferred to stay in the deli and listen to more reminiscence . At this stage Allen was still attempting to ring the changes from movie to movie so full marks for something of a departure if not for peopling the movie with real-life Borcht-circuit Jewish comics and throwing in non-verbal glimpses of Milton Berle , Sammy Davis , etc . Okay , it may be uneven but its heart's in the right place .
428496	3079504	69747	9.0	A relationship of a life time	I first saw this when I was a kid on its first US release back in the early 1970's . I laughed to kill myself and thought it was one of the funniest things I had ever seen . The quest to see the movie again over the last 30 years has been a labor of love . I don't think it ever aired on New York TV and its showings on cable can be counted on one hand . I was lucky enough to see it a a local revival theater a few years ago before it completely disappeared . Thanks to E-Bay I recently picked up a VHS copy and now comes word that a US release on DVD is moments away . Life couldn't be better . The one thing the handful of viewings of the film has taught me is that the movie plays differently every time I see it . Depending on mood it I may find it to be one of the funniest or one of the most charming films movies ever made . Some sequences in one viewing will leave me gasping for breath while other times it will simply make me smile . No matter though I've enjoyed it each time I've watched it . The story of a bigot who gets way laid and ends up on the run all over France only to end up posing as a beloved Rabbi , is ripe with comic potential most of which is put to good use . Also put to good use are some twists that no rational person would come up with , but which work in the context of a wild comedy , the bubble gum factory for example . This is a wonderful life affirming story that makes you laugh until you cry while showing that ultimately we are all the same . Which is kind of tragic in view of the films opening shots which are some of the earliest film footage shot at the World Trade Center , which had just opened . If you like to laugh see this movie , its wonderful .
437658	306861	33268	10.0	Out On A Ledge With Mr . Duck	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald & Pluto are WINDOW CLEANERS on a large skyscraper , but the Duck's day comes unstrung when he plays a joke on a very belligerent bee . . . This was one of a small handful of cartoons to co-star the Duck and the Pup , their very different personalities bouncing well off of each other . The addition of the Bee to the mix only adds to the vertiginous hilarity . The legendary Carl Barks wrote the story ; Clarence Nash supplied Donald with his unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
490031	33913	133302	10.0	Legendary Documentary !	PBS's Frontline has been a source of both information and enlightenment . It's one of the shows that is sorely not advertised enough because it's on public television . They show an unbiased , objective point of view regarding any issue , situation , or circumstances . One of the episodes is about climbing Mount Everest in May 1996 where several experienced climbers died after reaching the summit , a rare accomplishment for anybody . In fact , watching the documentary makes me want to climb it even though I would never get past first camp where you have to spend 3 weeks to get accumulated to the thin air . Everybody in the documentary regarding the climb on Mount Everest comes across as real and authentic . For those of us who would never make it to Everest , this documentary allows us to experience through the people's voices and memories that come alive in their re-telling almost better than any film version .

Focusing on some people in Japan considering what will be the memory that they take with them when they die , the movie really holds you . The story is somewhere between metaphysical and psychological , but incredible nonetheless . I don't know director Hirokazu Koreeda or any of the cast members , but if this is any indication , they all must be masterful . All in all , you have to see this movie . You may never feel the same about life or death again .
558880	2626332	260866	4.0	Moderately ( but unintelligently ) amusing .	Not bad , but it would have been better had they switched roles between Oliver Platt and Michael Douglas . I realize that Michael Douglas is the son of Kirk Douglas , and therefore is cast in the leading " Alpha " male roles . However , I think this production would have gone up at least 2 points with Oliver Platt in the lead , and Michael Douglas in the supporting role . The Premise of this movie is as follows : A young lady who has been institutionalized throughout her life , has a very powerful secret . Can her doctors break through her many psychosis in order to obtain the secrets locked within her mind ? They had better hope they can , or the lives of the doctors may be forfeit . Not a bad premise , and a very entertaining endeavor , with a few twists and turns , but nothing you don't really expect . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
462451	2467618	18106	8.0	If you DON'T think of it as a Laurel and Hardy film , it's exceptional for 1927	While this is often billed as a " Laurel and Hardy film " , it really isn't . A more correct description might be a " Laurel and James Finlayson film with a small bit part by Oliver Hardy " . And as long as your heart is not 100 % set on seeing a Laurel and Hardy film , you'll probably enjoy this film a lot , as the film does compare very well to the other comedy shorts released at the latter portion of the silent era . James and Stanley are involved in a situation that would later be repeated in several Laurel and Hardy shorts - - a woman from James ' past is trying to blackmail him into paying her for silence . James did nothing wrong , as he dated this woman years earlier , but this evil vixen threatens to tell the wife and swear James has been seeing her AFTER he got married ! So , desperate and unwilling to risk telling the wife the truth , he gets his employee , Stanley , to run interference by taking the vixen out for a good time until James can slip away and make the payoff . Unfortunately , Stan is ALSO married and the bad woman makes his life pretty tough as well . Much of the film is spent on this dilemma . However , the film ends very well with an exceptional sight gag , as Stan tries to nonchalantly walk out the door with , . . . well , I guess you just need to see this final scene yourself . Despite not truly being a Laurel and Hardy film , the short is very well-made and entertaining . Give it a shot - - it's much better than you'd expect from a film without the later Laurel and Hardy formula .

The story isn't particularly important as the film is more a conglomeration of misadventures which beset the duo as they run afoul of a bunch of street punks , cops , a really weird tow truck driver and his hottie wife , and more . Chock full of gross-out and potty humor , T but no A , blatant vulgarity , silly situational comedy moments , and some unoriginal stuff borrowed from other films , this raucous road trip flick is not for the sophisticated and will play best with " boomer babies " and the college crowd .

518120	8239592	77864	8.0	A sweet and engaging comedy	Bud Spencer gives a wonderfully warm and charming performance as Bulldozer , an amiable , but ill-tempered former pro football player turned fisherman who's recruited by a wacky gang of street people to whip them into shape for a major all-or-nothing football game against a rival group of American soldiers led by gung-ho jerk Sergeant Kempfer ( a deliciously obnoxious portrayal by Raimund Harmstorf ) . Director Michele Lupo and screenwriters Marcello Fondato and Francesco Scardamaglia concoct a blithely silly and lighthearted comedy that not only delivers the expected amusingly goofy slapstick humor ( several wild rough'n'tumble fight scenes in particular are absolutely hilarious ) , but also a nice small coastal town atmosphere , likable characters , and a truly uplifting story in which Bulldozer gives his misfit team a much-needed sense of self-worth while the team in turn help Bulldozer regain his passion for the game . Spencer easily carries the film on his massive shoulders as the decent and honorable Bulldozer ; he receives excellent support from Kempfer , Ottaviano Dell'Aqua as smartaleck Gerry , Marco Stefanelli as lanky klutz Tony , Giovanni Vettorazzo as swift , wily thief Spitz , and Reinhard Kolldehoff as the stern Colonel Martin . Both Franco Di Giacomo's slick cinematography and the bubbly score by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis are up to speed . The climactic football game is very funny , gripping and exciting . A hugely enjoyable little hoot .
517258	1132073	32917	10.0	Excellent Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Curly is A Plumbing We Will Go ! All appearing in this short are Symona Boniface , Monte Collins , Dudley Dickerson , Bess Flowers , Bud Jamison , Eddie Laughton , John Tyrrell ! There are so many funny parts here and the scenes with Bud Jamison are is really cool . There are two other Three Stooges shorts with Shemp very similar like this one called Vagabond Loafers and Scheming Schemers . A Plumbing We Will Go is a very hilarious short and I recommend it !
436304	9938570	185937	10.0	The Blair Witch Project	" We are going to die out here . " Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since " The Blair Witch Project " was all the buzz , revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers , causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying , skakey camera work ( . . but , if you think about it , this only gives this piece merit , these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement ) , and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real , that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit . Watching it for the first time since , hell , 2000 I guess , I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps . It was as if I were with them , deep into the woods lost , the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me . I envisioned just what it would be like , there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance , even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine . . particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent . I mean , snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies . At first , I could understand how three film students , Heather , Josh , & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill . . it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say to possibly a This documentary , as seen early on , seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods . It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it , providing our students with fuel for later laughter . I enjoyed how , as this continues , the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule . I found this actually rather believable and realistic , it worked for me . I could see a couple of people I either barely know , or know just from reputation , getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening . These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen . Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men ? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help . The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera . I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain . I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion , but this sure worked for me . . I mean just think about it for a minute : lost in the woods , sounds and voices in the distance , you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods , one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness , and rocks ( . . not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin , neatly intertwined within sticks , cloth & string ) formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone . It sure would have me peeing in my pants .
433482	2171244	295004	7.0	Another Bravura performance by Huppert	In a recent interview , Dustin Hoffman ( Mr . Magorium's Wonder Emporium ) was talking about his upcoming film , Last Chance Harvey . He described it as " the kind of film that has been coming out for years in France . . . We don't believe in middle-aged love stories . " Why wait for Hoffman's film next year , when you can see the amazing Isabelle Huppert ( The Piano Teacher , The Bedroom Window ) , who was an incredible looking 49 when she made this film . OK , a slowly unfolding relationship between Huppert and Pascal Greggory , the same age , doesn't appeal to you . You would rather drool over Keira Knightley , Emily Blunt , Ellen Page or Megan Fox . But , to dismiss one of the truly great actresses of our time would be a mistake . Like many , I love on-the-edge-of-your-seat action and dazzling special effects , but there are time when I just want to sit back with a special beverage and let beautiful cinematography , soothing music , and brilliant acting slowing wash over me . Olivier Dahan's ( La Vie en rose , Crimson Rivers 2 : Angels of the Apocalypse ) film fits the bill perfectly .
429487	1173088	250797	10.0	Unheralded	What would you do if you found out that your spouse was having an affair outside of your marriage ? Most likely what most people do when it happens to them - - go to marriage counseling or seek a nasty divorce . Edward ( Richard Gere ) does something different : he kills the man his wife is seeing and tries to cover up the crime . It is , in a way , the perfect murder - - no one else knew about the affair his wife was having , no evidence traced the victim to his killer . At least that is what Edward thinks as he rushes to attend his son's school play . Soon the irony starts and the tension builds . Edward gave his wife , Connie ( Diane Lane ) , a snow globe as a present . She then gave it to her lover ( Olivier Martinez ) . And when Edward finally confronts his wife's newfound boy toy prior to the killing , he sees the globe sitting near his bed . " Where did you get this ? " he asks , before delivering a massive blow to the side of his enemy's face and inadvertently killing him with the glass ball . It's an accident . He didn't mean to kill the man and he didn't even mean to overreact . But as the reality of the affair bombards his senses , Edward literally collapses , sent into a spiraling downfall of vengeance and anger . It's Richard Gere's best performance - - ever . I'm not a fan of Gere , but he brings so much raw intensity and reality to his character here that it's hard to not realize his performance as one of the best of the decade thus far . Observe his facial features as he examines the bedroom of his wife's lover . Imagine yourself in his place and imagine yourself not reacting the exact same way . But Gere is also able to bring a touching sense of love and humanity to Edward . His affection for his wife is as clear as sparkling water , and the day she comes home after encountering her new boyfriend he suspects something is wrong . Watch Gere in this film and you'll soon find yourself reconsidering whether or not he's that bad of an actor . I know I did . And you actually empathize with him . This is the man whose films have made more money the more he has become naked on-screen ; the man who is renowned for being a playboy hotshot and a sleazy celebrity pretty boy . But yet in " Unfaithful , " Gere abandons this self-made image , and plays a meek , nerdy family man living a modest life with a wife and a son . He wears glasses , lives an ordinary wife and actually respects his wife . His performance is spot-on and heartfelt , to say the least . I could have imagined almost anyone playing this role , except Gere . His performance is amazing . After killing Martinez and dumping the body in the back of his car , Edward takes the snow globe home . He places it on a shelf behind many other souvenir globes . Imagine Connie's surprise when she sees it there , and imagine the irony in the situation : they both know that they know each other's secret . Yet since they both are shameful of what they are done , they are too scared to confront each other , for fear of being accused of their own crimes . " Unfaithful " is one of the most elegant and firmly constructed thrillers in years - - realistic , cruel , ironic , and irreverently erotic . It's not your standard-issue sleaze . It's not all heavy on sex and style like " Basic Instinct " and it's not pure stupidity , either . It's actually a thriller rooted in a touching story of marriage and faith , and everything else gradually follows thereafter . Like " A Simple Plan , " " Bound " and " Fargo , " " Unfaithful " is about one single event that suddenly causes a chain reaction of horrific ones . In " A Simple Plan , " the moment that Hank took the cash was the moment his life changed forever . The moment that Corky's plan proceeded forwards in " Bound " was the moment that all hell broke loose and everything went wrong . And the moment that Jerry Lundegaard sent those two bumbling idiots on their way to kidnap his wife and hold her ransom was the same moment in time that his life would begin to dramatically fall apart , almost overnight . And the moment that Edward strikes his wife's lover with a small glass snowball is the moment that both of their wives - - his own and his wife's - - change forever . I love these sorts of movies , the kind that take your average , innocent passersby and place them in an unfortunate chain reaction that leads to a major downfall in their lives . Why do I love these movies ? I think for the same reason that has made them all so successful : we love to watch characters corrupt themselves and get caught in conspiracies where they are literally fighting to stay above water . The scene in " Fargo " where Jerry's plan falls apart all at once is a great example of this . This is Adrian Lynne's crowning achievement . It's glossy and masterfully , beautifully constructed . It's eerie and realistic and has a noticeably strong , yet strangely subtle , presence . I cannot imagine a more effective , sensitive and touching adaptation of this story that will surely hit close to home for many people out there . Even if it's not relative to your life , you will still find yourself deeply absorbed by the lead characters and their turmoil . " Unfaithful " has its flaws , but I find it hard to think of a more effective and beautiful thriller of its genre made within the past five years . stars . - John Ulmer
486392	386241	44320	5.0	Weak , lowbrow comedy that can still make you laugh in spite of yourself	Considering that Abbott and Costello had done " Meet The Invisible Man " the previous year , this film was a big comedown for them . But then again , considering that around the same period they also did " Comin ' Round The Mountain " and " Lost In Alaska " , maybe " Meet Captain Kidd " was par for the course . The saddest part here ( apart maybe from all the singing that at times makes you feel as if you're watching a second-rate musical ) is to observe how few verbal elements have remained in A & C's comedy ; instead , their humor has been reduced to the lowbrow , unsophisticated slapstick of mugging , dumb misunderstandings , and people falling down or getting hit with shovels . But sometimes A & C's talent still comes through and the film can make you laugh in spite of yourself . Charles Laughton is loud , bombastic and takes a lot of bumps , to generally unfunny effect ; Hillary Brooke is downright sexy as a female captain , and is without a doubt the brightest spot of this movie .

499150	1355507	106449	6.0	OK horror anthology .	Body Bags starts in a morgue where the attendant ( John Carpenter ) enjoys his job , he particularly likes the stiffs that come in in black body bags for they contain the murder , accident & suicide victims . Each one seems to have they're own morbid tale of how they ended up on the coroners autopsy table . . . Jump to Haddonfield where our first story titled ' The Gas Station ' is set . A serial killer is on the loose & new gas station employee Anne ( Alex Datcher ) is preparing for a long lonely night-shift . Anne becomes increasingly paranoid about everyone who turns up believing any of them may be a serial killer . . . The next body belongs to a someone who committed suicide in a story called ' Hair ' . Richard Coberts ( Stacy Keach ) is losing his hair & it's ruining his life , confidence & self esteem . Wanting to impress his girlfriend Megan ( Sheena Easton ) he contacts Dr . lock ( David Warner ) who promises a miracle hair regrowth treatment , unfortunately the procedure has some unexpected & very much unwanted side-effects . . . The final segment is entitled ' Eye ' & features pro baseball player Brent Matthews ( Mark Hamil ) who appears to have an almost perfect life , that is until he is involved in a car accident in which he loses his right eye . However Dr . Lang ( John Agar ) has spent the past 10 years of his life perfecting an eye transplant & Brent becomes the first beneficiary of the treatment , unfortunately the operation is not without it's problems . . . Featuring & co-executive produced by John Carpenter who also co-composed the music & directed two of the three segments , The Gas Station & Hair while Tobe Hooper directed Eye & he also has a small cameo in the film at the very end . I generally really like anthologies & Body Bags is fair entertainment I suppose but it could have been so much more . The first story The Gas Station is predictable & feels more like a slasher condensed into 30 odd minutes . The second story Hair is anything but predictable , this is one bizarre idea & is by far the most effective of the three stories as long as you can suspend your disbelief long enough . God knows who came up with the idea for this segment but they sure have one hell of an imagination . The third story Eye is also predictable as it's just a clichéd body part taking over type scenario & most disappointingly of all I guessed the ending within two minutes of Brent having the transplant . The script by Billy Brown & Dan Angel really could have done with stronger ideas & should have included twist ending for all three segments . Director's Carpenter & Hooper film with competence but the low TV budget & production values are hard to ignore . Carpenter seems to pay homage to himself as he sets The Gas Station in Haddonfield while the film is littered with genre personalities , from director's like Wes Craven , Sam Raimi & Roger Corman to actor's like Tom Arnold , David Naughton , George ' Buck ' Flower , Deborah Harry , Twiggy & John Agar besides those I've already name-checked . There is some gore here , various plucked out eyeballs rolling around & a graphic operation sequence when Brent has his new eye implanted , a silly autopsy scene , a slit throat , someone is crushed under a car with loads of blood gushing everywhere , a pair of hedge trimmers in someones eye & a cut arm . Technically Body Bags is pretty solid considering it's a TV produced film , nothing spectacular but at the same time it's generally well made . There is some decent stop motion animation in Hair while the other special effects are also OK . The acting was fine & there are plenty of familiar faces . Body Bags isn't the best horror anthology out there by any means but I've always liked this sub-genre so maybe I'm being a bit generous . Disappointing in some respects but still worth a watch if you've got nothing else to do .
555385	1406078	43370	7.0	USO entertainment	LLoyd Bacon , the director of " Call me Mister " , had an excellent track record as the man that gave us " 42 Street " , " Gold Diggers of 1936 " , " The Frisco Kid " , and " Brother Orchid " , among others . The film is based in a musical review with music by Harold Rome and Arnold Auerbach . The plot is a vehicle to show Betty Grable in a musical about a USO performer in post war Japan . The story is just a pretext to present Ms . Grable as an entertainer who wants to share joy among the troops still awaiting repatriation . Ms . Grable had such an effervescence about herself , it's easy to fall under her spell even in such a silly comedy as this one . Dan Dailey plays the man in Ms . Grable's life . He was an excellent singer and dancer who always projected a masculine presence in anything he did . Both Ms . Grable and Mr . Dailey make a winning combination in the movie . We get to see other faces that went to make names for themselves . Dale Robertson , Danny Thomas , Richard Boone , Jeffrey Hunter , Frank Fontaine , Jerry Paris and Bobby Short , among others . The musical numbers were staged by Busby Berkley , a man who always had an edge in everything he did . The last production number stands out as the four principals , Ms . Grable , Mr . Dailey , Ms . Venata and Mr . Thomas take to the stage . That was entertainment !

You want to test my powers of deduction " or " Mercy is not a virtue of the wicked " ) , the acting is bad ( especially by O'Keeffe and the guy who plays Zor ) , the special effects are embarrassing , the script is full of digressions instead of sticking to whatever story it has to tell . . . . . BUT this still a quite harmless film , and not the worst of its type ; out of those I've seen , " Hercules II " with Lou Ferrigno still holds that title . ( )
409593	2567136	494238	6.0	And A Little Child Shall Read Them	Although the credits make it clear that this is an adaptation of a novel ( which I've never heard of or read ) it has all fingermarks of something designed by a committee ; flying monkeys as in The Wizard Of Oz ( which is utilised in another context ) , a James Bond-type villain bent on world domination , a device for entering another world like The Lion , The Witch And The Wardrobe and so on . The problem is it's something of a one-trick pony - the trick in this case being books that ' come to life ' under certain readers voices - and ultimately it's not that different and / or better than all the other ' fantasies ' out there , not that it's worse either but it needs more of a voice if it is to be anything more than a diversion on a wet Wednesday .
582563	1219578	44476	7.0	We are not helpless .	It's strange how this Wise movie influenced " Invasion of the body snatchers " . The construction is exactly the same : a car belting with a couple inside : close shots on their faces , full of fear . They take refuge in a police station , and the man begins his story which he records on a tape . Like in " body snatchers " , there's a description of Kennington , a peaceful town , but little by little , the witness , a journalist , reveals us what lies beneath . And by the way , in 1945 , Wise made a movie called " the body snatcher " ! The town seems to be under Sirak's thumb , a local tycoon who has a hand in shady and illegal business . The police is totally corrupted , and , it's the last analogy with " Body snatchers " , ordinary people seem contaminated too ( the car salesman ) , or about to be ( the journalist's partner ) . A private eye tried to spill the beans , but he was murdered soon after having asked for the journalist's help . The murder scene is masterfully directed by Wise whose editing science is astounding : the private , driven back against a dead end street , in a symphony of black and white , by a mysterious car which will come back as an ominous messenger of death , then , abruptly , a trumpet bellowing out in a nightclub . Violence always takes place in the night , in Wise ' s world ( remember the end of " odds against tomorrow " , or even the rumble in " west side story " ) . The characters are realistic to a fault . No stereotype , no real baddie ( except for the gangsters whom we hardly see ; their presence can be felt everywhere though , that is to say how great Wise is ! ) It seems that Sirak is actually overtaken by events . Characters of secondary importance are wonderfully depicted : Sirak's wife , whom we see only twice in the movie appears at first as an indifferent woman , then , a fearful , pitiful one , an alcoholic at that . The main message of the movie is that we are not helpless , as the private detective's wife told the journalist soon after her husband ' s death . If the gangsters took over the town , it's because of people ( ordinary people ) who are too afraid of getting mixed up in a fight against the strong and the mighty , or worse , because bribes make ends meet . In 1952 , with no star , a low budget , and a great modesty , Wise showed the way to modern film noir .
455114	11228318	26153	5.0	Buddy's Lost World was an okay cartoon starring the forgotten Buddy	In this Leon Schlesinger / Looney Tunes cartoon short , Buddy and his dog Bozo are sailing to the Lost World , you know , that world inhabited by cavemen and dinosaurs as first depicted by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his novel of the same name . The animation is good and the cartoon moves at a brisk pace though after a while , nothing makes real sense and Buddy's bland personality isn't enough for this animated short's charm . Still , if you're a Warner Bros . cartoon completist , Buddy's Lost World is worth seeing at least once . By the way , the studio would go back to prehistoric times when Chuck Jones made Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur , which featured a caricatured Jack Benny , some four years later .
468716	1532177	83862	4.0	What Happened To Ian McKellen ?	DYING DAY is another story from ITV's ARMCHAIR THRILLER series . It revolves around a gentleman called Anthony Skipling ( Played by Ian McKellen - No I don't know what became of his acting career either ) who befriends a man on a train . This man is a total anorak who likes to record sounds of nature " Badgers farting . Fascinating " . Mr Anorak gets off the train at the station . Moments later there's a tapping on the train window and Mr Skipling turns to see Mr Anorak clawing at the window with his eyes gouged out ! ! ! ! ! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! Mr Anorak leaves behind an audio tape which Skipling plays only to find out that there's a murder plot involved . He goes to the police to inform them of a murder at the train station but the police investigation finds no evidence of this . Worse when Skipling plays the audio tape to the detectives the murder plot has been erased . Another character is introduced into the story ( Sorry but I forgot what his name was ) who seems to be stalking Skipling who over the course of the 4 half hour episodes is becoming more and more insane . In the final episode Skipling snaps and pushes his supposed stalker under a train . I don't know why I typed in major spoilers ahead because it becomes fairly obvious as to where DYING DAY is heading early on . It turns out Mr Anorak isn't actually dead and has used his " murder " and audio tape to make Skipling appear as a deluded man in order to kill the man who is " stalking " Mr Skipling with the story ending with Skipling in a lunatic asylum talking to camera . It's very contrived just like all the other stories under the ARMCHAIR THRILLER banner and is probably only worth seeing if you're interested in watching Sir Ian Mckellen when he had to slum it as an actor
398956	1391795	37644	8.0	Solid little crime drama .	Real-life tough guy Lawrence Tierney has one of the best parts of his acting career : notorious real-life criminal John Dillinger . This right-to-the-point little movie basically concentrates on his robbing and killing spree . Upon his original incarceration , Dillinger meets " Specs " Green ( Edmund Lowe ) and Greens ' small group of friends , and after he springs them out of jail , they embark on their crime spree , with the headstrong Dillinger ultimately figuring to take Greens ' place as leader of the gang . The cast is great in this efficiently paced and action-packed B flick . It runs a scant 70 minutes , with no filler , and is told in a real matter-of-fact style . Its suggestions of brutal violence ( such as Dillingers ' revenge on a waiter ) work just as well as any in-your-face bloodshed ever could . Tierney is ideal for the role of a ruthless criminal and is ably supported by Eduardo Ciannelli , Marc Lawrence , Elisha Cook , Jr . and beautiful Anne Jeffreys as his female companion . Dimitri Tiomkin supplies a typically excellent music score . " Dillinger " is an all-business , unsentimental , and enjoyably dark crime saga . It's entertaining from beginning to end .
367985	2707735	119668	9.0	" . . . this place is fantastic , it's like ' Gone With The Wind ' on mescaline . "	Kelso's ( John Cusack ) quote in the summary above just about says it all for this film , it was a blast and a half to watch with graveyard voodoo rituals and the brazen performance of Lady Chablis . About the time Jim Williams ( Kevin Spacey ) was having his heart attack , and getting the knowing smile from Billy Hanson ( Jude Law ) , I felt the film had borrowed a chapter from ' The Twilight Zone ' . Not having read the book , my viewing had no preconceptions of how the story should be presented , perhaps a good thing judging by the comments of other reviewers on this board . Kevin Spacey was entirely credible as a sophisticated Southern gentleman ; Cusack as the reporter might have shown more range but he played off the other characters well enough . Knowing nothing of the actor who portrayed Lady Chablis , imagine my surprise when I learned that he / she was actually a real person . That might explain the lack of an award nomination , there isn't a category . The line on the witness stand about having a ' man's toolbox ' was the best . This was quite the entertaining story , with a twist that makes the innocent Jim Williams guilty , capitalizing on a police error to ride out the jury trial . Mysterious forces at work bring him to justice however , cleverly linked by the midnight handiwork of priestess Minerva and the restless spirit of the murdered Billy . It's a minor role for Jude Law , though he brings some manic tension to the proceedings . However if you only need one reason to see the film , it's hands down Lady Chablis , setting us up with - " Would you care to see something a little more . . . unusual ? "
533244	70535	89886	5.0	Animal House revisited	Absolutely nothing new with this offering . Reminded me a lot of one of the worst films I ever saw , Animal House . Surely real geeks don't act this silly , eh ? The popcorn bit was pretty neat , but this format has been done before . First movie I've seen yet with Kilmer that I didn't enjoy , he is a good player but I simply hated his character in this one .
484591	1416505	70634	7.0	Not the most spectacular Dracula movies but yet it's also one of the more solid ones .	This is the eight Dracula movie entry from the Hammer studios , which began first in 1958 with the movie " Dracula " and ended in 1974 with the movie " The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires " . All of these Dracula movies are of variating quality but they all have in common that they are entertaining to watch , like basically every Hammer movie ever made . There is a bit too much talking though at times and not enough ' action ' , so to speak , though toward the ending this certainly changes . It doesn't make the movie dull or anything but still makes it feel a b bit overlong . Nevertheless the movie has a good and original enough story . The movie does a good job at putting the old fashioned Dracula character into ' modern ' 1974 ( even though the movie itself already got released in 1973 ) . This is something most modern horror movies could learn from . The story mixes the occult with the Dracula legend , combined with some modern police work . Peter Cushing once more plays a true excellent role as a decedent of the good old Abraham Van Helsing . A character he played numerous times before throughout his career . Christopher Lee also reprises his role again as the famous blood-sucking count . It would be the last time he would play the character , though he played vampire characters again in later movies . It was a real worthy last Dracula performance by him . As often the Dracula role is also really restrained in this movie . He doesn't even show up for the first time when we are already well halve way through the movie . Nevertheless its always great seeing Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing acting in one and the same sequence together . The movie besides also features a fine British supporting cast with some fine actors . The movie is well directed by Alan Gibson , who also directed the previous Hammer studios Dracula entry " Dracula A . D . 1972 " . The movie further more features some wonderful editing and camera-position at times , like you would expect from an ' 70's movie . Also surprising good was the musical score by John Cacavas , that suits the movie real well . The movie knows to create a good and also certain tense and mysterious atmosphere . It adds to the reason why this movie is such a perfectly watchable one . It surely a movie that entertains withs story , characters and actors which are portraying them . A great Hammer movie !
385539	391152	140307	7.0	Okay , but kind of generic	Afraid to Die , one of the four Yasuzo Masumura films that Fantoma has recently released on DVD , contains several examples of the directorial mastery of the same man who directed Giants and Toys and Bind Beast - in fact , the entire film is skillfully directed - but the script is terribly dull . Also working against the film is Yukio Mishima . He was the original draw for the film . He was a famous novelist at the time , probably the most famous in Japan , and his fans desperately wanted to see him in a film . Unfortunately , he's not a very good actor . I guess his poor performance is just as well blamed on the script , though . His character fluctuates a lot . We're supposed to like him , or at least sympathize with him , but that's not really possible . He's a pure scumbag . Afraid to Die is worth watching . It's not very long , and , like I said above , there are a couple of great scenes . One particular death scene is alone worth the price of a rental , if you're lucky enough to find it on your local video shelf . If you're thinking about buying any of Fantoma's Masumura DVDs , this one's not really worth it . Definitely buy Giants and Toys and Blind Beast . I haven't yet seen Manji . I did order it , though , so by the time you read this I could have already posted a review . Check it out . For Afraid to Die : .
431144	1173088	1125849	10.0	One of the best films of 2008	Enough has been written already about Mickey Rourke's real-life parallels with his fictional character in The Wrestler . Yes , it makes the story seem even realer , and is perhaps what attracted Rourke to the project . ( Or perhaps not ? perhaps , instead , it is what attracted Darren Aronofsky to the actor . ) But to focus on such surface similarities seems like an undermining of his work here . Rourke may not be as out-of-his-comfort-zone as Sean Penn in Milk , the only other Oscar-worthy lead performance this year , but that is merely a testament to his fundamental understanding of his character : Randy is an understated guy with big scars , both literally and figuratively . He's been wrestling for years ? now reduced to borderline tribute shows in front of dwindling crowds , scrounging up barely enough cash to buy the variety of drugs and steroids he needs to maintain his weight . He lives in a trailer park and gets locked out for not being able to keep up rent . He works part-time at a grocery store and visits strip clubs regularly , because it's the only place where he seemingly has any meaningful connections with another human being ? namely the dancer Cassidy ( played by Marisa Tomei ) , who is similarly a bit older than most peers in her " profession , " yet doesn't really know any other way to live . The Wrestler draws immediate comparison to the classics of working class cinema , including Rocky and On the Waterfront . Sylvester Stallone returned to his iconic character two years to bring resolution to the life of Rocky Balboa , the Philly boxer who got back in the ring for one final match . It was a good film and touched on similar themes ? a nice guy stuck in a mean world , an estranged child ? and ultimately both films present us with the dilemma these men find themselves in : too old to continue doing what they know best , and too old to learn how to do anything else . Whereas Rocky Balboa was a trip down memory lane , it was hardly as bleak or frank as The Wrestler , which is a vastly superior film . Darren Aronofsky has established himself with this picture as one of the most important of modern American filmmakers ; to acknowledge that this work is from the same man who directed The Fountain is astonishing , because they couldn't be farther apart on a sylistic level . The Wrestler is grainy , low-key and rough . It isn't polished , fantastical or elaborate . And that suits the material perfectly . The fact that Aronofsky was willing to almost entirely reinvent his approach for the benefit of the story is more than admirable . He deserves a nomination . Tomei is wonderful in her supporting role , fleshing out her character ( again , both literally and figuratively ) with greater competence than most actresses would probably be able to manage , because it's a fairly obvious role ? the " stripper with a heart of gold " who is the object of desire for the gruff guy with a tortured soul . Yet she manages to strike a balance in the film as one of two female roles , the other belonging to Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's emotionally severed daughter . The Wrestler is impressive for all its smaller parts as well as the larger ones . When Randy goes to visit his daughter , the reaction is fleeting ; it's not overly dramatic and revelatory , like most films of this nature often create such scenes to be . We can tell by her reaction that it's not the first time Randy has attempted to reconcile with her , as she seems unfazed by his appearance on her doorstep . It is in this fashion that the film jumps through all the mandatory hoops of its genre ( think , of all things , The Royal Tenenbaums ) , yet still manages to seem fresh and realistic . And then there's Rourke . As aforementioned , he deserves the Oscar nom he's likely to receive . And he should probably win . This is one of the best performances of the decade , perhaps even of all time , if we really want to get down to it . It's the best work of his career , at once the most fully developed of his characters and the most imperfect . Randy isn't airbrushed to make him seem more appealing to the audience ; Aronofsky and Rourke exploit his faults and present him as a normal man , tempted by vices and haunted by his past . Yet we recognize that the drugs , the empty sex and the generally self-destructive behavior Randy partakes in is rooted in the same emotional enguish that the actor himself seems to carry with him ; Aronofsky spotted this quality in Rourke , and he fought the producers for Rourke over their first choice ( Nicolas Cage ) , and his dedication paid off ? you'll be hard-pressed to find a more convincing , moving or memorable lead performance this year . Ultimately , The Wrestler is one of the year's very best films ? a character study that is at once timeless and powerful . And it's helmed by a director who has managed to bounce back from an aesthetically pleasing but shallow art-house film to produce one of the great works of American cinema in the 21st century .
515491	317399	421994	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Imagine Me & You	I'm not sure if that bubblegum tune can belong amongst the gay anthems , given that Wong Kar Wai's had a gay themed movie titled Happy Together and used the same song too . Yes well , as you would already know , GLBT movies from UK are emerging , from Kinky Boots earlier ( one of my faves for the year ) , and now Imagine Me & You hitting our shores next week . Rachel ( Piper Perabo , a dead ringer for Rachel McAdams ) and Hector ( Matthew Goode , from Match Point ) are about to get married after years of courtship . On their wedding day , Rachel notices Luce ( Lena Headey ) from the corner of her eye , and from brief introductions turned into family gatherings , turned into something more . Rachel experiences strange feelings for Luce and the feelings turned out to be mutual , but what about Hector ? It's a classic case of everyone's worst nightmare come true , finding out that the person you're about to marry , or have married , actually loves somebody else , and that someone else being the same sex just compounds the effect . One character said in passing that anybody can swing to the other camp , before a slight hesitation , correcting that only probably he wouldn't . And that made an interesting caveat which the movie explores - how do you know if your sexual orientation is rock solid ( that might seem a " d'uh " statement until you watch the movie ) , or do you have the tendency to swing ( think Kinsey had a theory on this ) . What if you find yourself experiencing this inexplicable force of feelings you never knew for someone else , when you're already married or with a life partner ? And speaking of life partners , how do you know the one you're with , is the one for you ? And life partners being partners , must it always be in matrimony or strictly about the opposite sex ? At the end of the day , what matters is the chemistry and the ability to click , right ? The movie asks a lot of these questions beneath its cheerful yet melancholic veneer , although it never provides a straight answer . As always , you can replace the lesbian relationship here in the story with a heterosexual one , but it probably won't impact an audience as much ( just as Brokeback Mountain would work with a heterosexual couple , but will bore the heck out of audiences and not win any award at all ) . While the movie offers to suggest certain ideas like love at first sight , it doesn't really demonstrate that effectively ( more like lust at first sight ) nor seemed to have a valid reason to do so , though it toyed with the fleeting thought about reincarnation . You might feel that writer-director Ol Parker had filled the movie with plenty of romantic clichés and notions about setting someone free if you really love them , or the thought about being with someone you can live without rather than someone you can live with . In fact , the entire premise might be a bit contrived , but hey , if you think about it , the world is full of quirky events and people , so maybe something like this could happen too . This movie should do reasonable well amongst the GLBT crowd with its theme , and given the eye candy cast , probably will do well as a whole . It's nothing spectacular , just that as a movie , it should work the crowd like clockwork
586867	783721	117394	7.0	Odd , dark , and not for everyone	" Deep Crimson " , a subtitled Mexican film , tells of a man who uses his hair-piece , good looks , and charm to bilk mature women out of their money . When he woos a very large and homely woman longing to be loved , she divests herself of her children , insinuates herself into his life , and goes off scamming with him while pretending be his sister . The backbone of the story is the strange symbiosis which develops between the partner / lover duo as we watch their relationship grow deeper and their scheming more nefarious . A moderately entertaining though schizophrenic film , " Deep Crimson " is too much of a comedy to be taken seriously and too much of a drama to be funny . The result is a marginally engaging film which will play best to those with a taste for black comedies from south of the border . ( B )

Some people may complain that their favorite actor was missing , and that the director really must have hated the franchise , but I feel that Joe Chappelle did a good job of keeping the story moving . And , there was a story . It wasn't just slash , slash , slash . There was actually something going on and it made it more interesting . Paul Rudd did a very good job as Tommy Doyle and Marianne Hagan was a string Kara Strode . I like the fact that Donald Pleasence is still around . Looking forward to seeing the rest .

Marvelously played by Peter Finch , Beale etched an unforgettable movie character . It was certainly a sad scene when Finch was posthumously awarded the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of a very frustrated anchorman . As a news honcho hot-shot lady , Faye Dunaway merited an Oscar for best actress . As a network executive , William Holden had to settle for a best actor nomination . Yet , his movie wife , Beatrice Straight , was the surprise winner of the best supporting actress award . Remember her outburst when he told her that he was leaving her ? You'd have to remember because that was one of her two scenes in this film , but she made the most out of it . " Network " is one of the few movies where 5 acting Oscar nominations occurred . As mentioned before , we had Finch , Holden , Dunaway and Straight nominated . Ned Beatty would join them with a supporting nomination . Great film for the news hounds .

This makes for a fun couple of minutes , and the idea and execution are well-done . The plot is simple , but sustains your interest for the duration . Pacing is good , this doesn't overstay its welcome . Acting isn't bad . Writing is probably Bertocci's strongest ( at least as far as the most immediately noticeable ) film-making talent , and this helps prove it . . . in the hands of a lesser writer , this wouldn't be anywhere near this remarkable . The cinematography is impressive , considering what the guy had to work with . The editing is spot-on . The story-telling device ( you'll know what I mean if you watch ) is put to good use . The lines are clever . This is just under five minutes long , complete with credits . Sound is fine . Not all of the comedy works , but the humor is mostly great . Bertocci makes great use of what he has at his immediate disposal , and definitely shows himself to be both creative and crafty . This should perhaps not be watched by anyone not at least a teenager , there is a mature theme or two . I recommend this to any fan of short films and quirky comedy .

Having managed to destroy traditional British comedy by the early ' 90's , the alternative comedy brigade then made complete fools of themselves by signing up for ' Carry On Columbus ' . Why , exactly ? Alexei Sayle was a vociferous critic of ' old school ' comics such as Les Dawson , so what's he doing here ? Actually , neither he , Rik Mayall , Julian Clary , Keith Allen and co . can be blamed for the film turning out a stinker . Sid James , Kenneth Williams and the original gang would have had a tough time making this dreadful script funny . It plays like a bad ' Carry On ' spoof done by ' The Comic Strip Presents ' team . Clary manages a few guffaws as a Hawtrey-substitute , but the only person to emerge with any credit is Jim Dale . Old-timers Jack Douglas , Leslie Phillips , June Whitfield and Jon Pertwee feature in so few scenes as to be barely noticeable . I pity anyone who paid to see it on its original release ; on television you can always change channels , or better still put on a ' Carry On Screaming ' D . V . D .
365403	4888011	80310	8.0	such stories have probably happened many times	When I first watched " ' Breaker ' Morant " , I had never heard of the instance during the Boer War when the Australian army executed some of its soldiers so as to cover up misdeeds by superior officers . The movie does a very good job looking at the story . Aside from top-notch acting by Bryan Brown and Edward Woodward ( among others ) and direction by Bruce Beresford ( who later directed " Driving Miss Daisy " ) , the movie brings up the very issue of war crimes . The charge was that these soldiers had committed atrocities against Dutch South Africans . It was obvious that the entire British army - and its affiliates - had been doing these sorts of things , and that the real problem was the empire's militaristic nature . The army just wanted to make it look as though they were serving justice . And this didn't end with the Boer War . The US army prosecuted Lt . William Calley for commanding the My Lai Massacre , but the architects of the Vietnam War got off Scot free . Suffice it to say , this all applies to the current state of affairs . But anyway , this is a really good movie . Definitely one that I recommend . And I bet that the aroma truly would have been a failure ! As it is , it hardly seems worth talking about atrocities against the Dutch South Africans ( known as Boers or Afrikaners ) , as they were the ones who established apartheid .
491873	3280905	26246	6.0	The Greatest " Detective " Novel of All ?	Fyodor Dostoeyevski is , without a doubt , one of the greatest novelists of his native Russia , of 19th Century Europe , and of world literature . That said , he is also a pain in the ass to read . If you are into his views of self-sacrifice and mysticism , and of redemption through intense , sometimes meaningless suffering , you can't find anyone else like him . If you also like anti-Western slavophilia , with more than a dollop of anti-Semitism , he's your guy . These aspects appear in his Russian contemporary Tolstoi too , but Count Leo had a more universal view of forgiveness and brotherhood than Fyodor ever had . Therefore Tolstoi makes his occasional snide comments , but they are quickly dropped - not intensively developed . With these serious reservations said , Dostoeyevski remains monumental . Most people recall him for two novels : CRIME AND PUNISHMENT and THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV . Neither of the two novels were ever successfully made into U . S . films , despite a great director in this 1935 version of the former novel , and a grade " A " cast and production in the 1958 version of the latter that starred Yul Brynner and Maria Schell . From what I have seen a Masterpiece Theatre version of CRIME AND PUNISHMENT in the 1970s was far closer to the novel than Von Sternberg's 1935 version . But Von Sternberg , working with Columbia Pictures , did not have as good a budget ( and certainly could not make a four hour film ) . CRIME AND PUNISHMENT has been called the first psychological detective novel , and the best . It is not a who-done-it in the spirit of Dashiell Hamnett's THE THIN MAN . It is more like a Columbo episode ( and Columbo's character is obviously modeled on the laid back , wise Detective Inspector Porphiry - who patiently allows Raskolnikov to give himself away and up ) . Dostoeyevski lets us see the killing of the old pawn broker and her sister , and understand the twisted " philosophical altruism " that Raskolnikov uses to commit his crime . It is a murder for social purposes - get rid of the leech like money lender / pawn broker , grab her money , and use it to aid those truly unfortunate in society . Had the murder been committed quickly with only the pawn broker killed , the absurd logic might have worked . Instead , because the sister of the victim sees the killing , Raskolnikov has to kill her too for self protection . From that time forward his philosophical base begins to crash . Also he discovers that the material answer of money is not enough to help the poor or those he comes to love . As such CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is ( no real slap at Conan Doyle ) light-years away in effectiveness from THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES . And watching the Russian police procedural in the novel , as Porphiry helps whittle away at Raskolnikov's iron core of beliefs is quite good too . Peter Lorre gives an affecting performance as the killer , one more role in a chain beginning with " M " that would continue for much of his admirable career . It must have been well received publicly . The Ritz Brothers spoofed his performance in one of their films . Arnold is fine as Porphiry , who has seen all the murder types ( and can quickly find their weak spot ) . Here , his best moment is when another lesser suspect confesses unexpectedly just as Lorre seemed about to confess . It leaves Porphiry perplexed and troubled , as the confession has been heard by witnesses ( including a smart aleck Lorre ) , and Porphiry realizes an innocent man has possibly put his life in danger by such an act . There are some good supporting touches too , especially seeing Mrs . Patrick Campbell in her last performance on screen as the pawnbroker , a dried up , malevolent figure that one does not waste too much pity on ( again , if she had been the only victim Raskolnikov's philosophical point would have been correct ) . Cuts due to budget and time considerations ruined several parts - Douglas Dumbrille as a married man who wants Lorre's sister ( Lorre can't stand him ) and who helps bring Lorre to book ( for personal reasons ) had a larger part in the novel , including suicide . That is not in the film . With all it's budget restraints though , it is a good introduction to the great novel and I recommend it .
512941	3223254	374277	8.0	A Touch of Pink and Touch of Class !	Ian Iqbal Rashid is a sensitive director who is bringing the two poles of Indian Bollywood and Indie ' Hollywood ' closer together . In TOUCH OF PINK he has taken the best of both and created a tender , charming , warmly funny tale of the struggle of a Pakistani young cameraman Alim ( Jimi Mistry ) in coming to grips with his sexuality . Yes , the story has been done many times , but rarely with the genuine tenderness Rashid has found . Alim , a transplanted Pakistani youth born in Kenya , raised in Toronto , Canada and living in London , has a guardian angel in the form of Cary Grant ( Kyle MacLachlan ) who has replaced his father he never knew and who is his constant companion in his flat in London - giving advice Alim wants to hear while acting as a curtain to shield Alim from the more difficult facts of his being an openly gay male . Alim is in love with Giles ( Kristen Holden-Ried ) and they live a happy life together - until Alim's mother Nuru ( Suleka Mathew ) comes to pay them a visit . Nuru has lived alone since her husband's death , always longing for a fantasy life of fleeing the restrictions of Indian culture to become a star like Doris Day . Her life is one of frustration and her hopes for something better seem to rest on her only son Alim's getting married so that Nuru can compete with her sister currently planning an extravagant wedding for her own son Khaled . Once in London , Nuru finds Alim cold , living with a British man , and finds her hopes for a possible wedding quashed . Giles takes the reluctant Nuru for a shopping and dancing day and wins her heart . But when Nuru finally discovers Alim's secret , she leaves London , hurt , sad , and despondent . Giles is angry with Alim's harsh handling of their relationship and leaves Alim to the sole companionship of his Cary Grant . Through a series of discoveries and introspection Alim flies to Toronto to the wedding of his cousin , to appease Nuru , and there Pandora's Box opens resulting is a series of surprises that bring the actions to resolution . Though many will have seen the end coming , for those who have not seen the movie , telling the plot ending would be a sad disservice ! The dialogue is smart , the use of the Cary Grant guardian angel is excellent ( especially given the fine performance by Kyle MacLachlan ) , and the characters as portrayed by this talented and attractive cast are indeed lovable . This is a feel-good movie , a fine statement about being true to one's self , and a healthy look at gay relationships that are not either 1 ) candy coated or 2 ) sadistic or doomed . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
483012	1293485	1038988	9.0	Oneof the scariest movies I have ever seen	OK , I admit it , I'm shallow , I didn't know about this film's existence until I saw Quarantine and went onto IMDb . com and saw all these complaints on how Rec was so much better . So I went onto youtube and found Rec just to see what it was like and the strange thing is , I saw Quarantine in the movie theater , I wasn't scared , I watched Rec on my computer and it scared me to death . I think the story was a little better explained in this version as well as it was just more intense . I feel weird saying that because Quarantine is the exact same movie just it's done in English , but for some weird reason this movie just scared me even more . I think I also liked the actors a little better in this movie because they seemed stronger and reacted more naturally . Rec is one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time and I really wish I checked it out earlier than I did . Angela is a TV reporter who does a quick little night segment on firefighters and what their jobs are like . Everything starts pretty boring and it seems like they're not going to get a great story . . . until there is a disturbance call . They all go to this apartment building where everyone is downstairs complaining about noises coming from this apartment with an older woman , the fireman and police go up there to find the woman very disturbed and mumbling . All of a sudden the woman tries to attack them , the police and firemen along with Angela go downstairs to find out that they've been locked in , the police outside have quarantined the building . The woman viciously bites one of the firemen who turns into a rabid zombie who starts attacking the others . The virus is spreading and there's only so much time before they all descend into this scary nightmare . I would highly recommend Rec for any movie fan , this was just a fun movie to watch and one of the better horror films I've seen . Quarantine was just the American version with a few deleted scenes that are not in Rec , but I felt that Rec explained itself better . Why and how the virus came to be as well as where the mysterious tenant is and what he did . Like I said , I do feel silly , they're both pretty much the exact same movie just in different languages , but I just enjoyed this movie was just better . So if you do get the opportunity , I do highly recommend going on the net and looking up this movie , it'll give you the heebee geebee's . . . OK , that was lame .
447460	1048771	57129	5.0	Julie Harris whimpers and cries her way through " The Haunting " . . .	This is one horror story by Shirley Jackson that had a lot of potential for film . . . and with Robert Wise at the helm , it's a pity it's spoiled by several unpleasant ingredients . One of those ingredients is JULIE HARRIS , who is a woman with demons in her past who can't rid herself of them no matter how hard others try to help her . Another is the lesbian theme that occurs midway . And finally , the whole story is done in a very understated way which leaves a lot up to the imagination of the viewer . This worked for films like THE UNINVITED and THE INNOCENTS , but here it just falls flat as a pancake . The horror is dissolved by an irritating central performance from Miss Harris , usually such a fine actress . CLAIRE BLOOM , RICHARD JOHNSON and RUSS TAMBLYN are part of a team sent to investigate the supernatural happenings at Hill House . The horror inherent in such a tale never quite gets as gripping as it should despite Wise's direction and some fairly good performances . Far more substantial , and equally understated in the horror department , are films like those mentioned above . This one leaves me cold and is much overrated by horror fans .
382333	449021	69976	7.0	Fearless . Relentless . Public Enemy # 1 .	Director John Milius also takes writing credit for this very colorful look at the most famous bank robber John Dillinger ( Warren Oates ) . This story begins in the middle of his criminal career ending in his death at the Biograph Theater . This is a very romanticized tale complete with Baby Face Nelson ( Richard Dreyfuss ) and Pretty Boy Floyd ( Steve Kanaly ) . Ben Johnson plays FBI agent Melvin Purvis who has an ego to match Dillinger's . Cloris Leachman plays Anna Sage , the infamous Woman in Red . Throw in Michelle Phillips as a girlfriend and Harry Dean Stanton as minion Homer Van Meter and you have the key players in this very colorful and violent movie . Liberty is taken with history for entertainment sake and besides the profanity filled script is not the selling point . . . the manic gun battles get most of the attention . The gun play is bloody and frequent ; some of the roughest ever filmed . For a less colorful , but very interesting version check out DILLINGER ( 1945 ) starring Lawrence Tierney .
423496	2248099	65424	6.0	Interesting enough low budget seventies exploitation	It must have been hard to imagine in 1973 that the director of this low budget shock flick would go on to make one of the very best crime films of the nineties with LA Confidential , but indeed that was the case . Anyway , this was his first attempt at directing , and it's a rather lukewarm film . I never go into films like this expecting too much ; generally these film were made with the intention of getting as many people into a theatre as possible and that isn't usually the best base for a great film . This one focuses on Eddie Collins , a disturbed man who gets into murdering women after one unsuccessful encounter and then ends up not being able to shake off the urge to do so . The film was obviously made on a shoestring budget and it does look very cheap . There's also rather too many sex scenes in the film which were obviously included to help sell the film , but actually end up making it all the more boring . Naturally the point of the film is to see the lead character butchering some women rather than any kind of character study , and that's really all we get . Still , Sweet Kill is not a total dead loss ; it makes for an interesting watch and fans of low budget seventies exploitation will probably get a kick out of it .
576283	1399158	56575	7.0	THAT TOUCH OF MINK ( Delbert Mann , 1962 )	To begin with , I can’t tell you how many times I’ve missed out on this one on Italian TV over the years ; in retrospect , my decision not to watch it had to do with two factors above all else – my resistance to Doris Day’s charms and the fact that this is the kind of film that ought to be watched in English , as the sparkling Oscar-nominated dialogue would lose a lot in the translation ( even if I did catch all of Day’s famous pairings with Rock Hudson in this manner – incidentally , there’s an amusing in-joke about him here ) . I say this because leading man Cary Grant is my favorite actor and this , one of his last vehicles , is well-regarded – ironically , now that I’ve finally got around to it , the viewing was still compromised by the panning-and-scanning of the image from the original Panavision format ( though it curiously reverted to the correct ratio for one scene set in a baseball stadium ) ! Anyway , THAT TOUCH OF MINK – chic , easy-going and considered by film critic Leslie Halliwell as the quintessential Doris Day movie – proved quite engaging despite essentially thin plotting . The cast ( including Gig Young as Grant’s cynical subordinate i . e . not his usual ‘Other Man’ characterization , Audrey Meadows ditto as Day’s room-mate , and John Astin as a lecher pursuing the typically virginal heroine ) is near-perfect and there’s a fair smattering of good dialogue and situations throughout its breezy 99-minute duration . My favorite line is when Grant remarks that Freud would have burnt his couch and gladly traded Psychology for a spot managing a delicatessen if he had to put up with Doris Day ; as for the comic highlights – Young , mistaken for Grant , being assaulted by Meadows every time he tries to get service at the canteen where she works and again when he tries to pay Doris a visit at her home ; Dick Sargent’s bit as a flustered newly-wed with spouse problems – at one point absent-mindedly walking straight into the pool – during the sojourn at Bermuda ; finally asked by the heroine for a date – if only to spite Grant , Astin can only muster a relative’s poultry van as a means of transportation , even needing to make a commission in Hoboken along the way ! ; there’s another bit of mistaken identity as first Grant and then Young barge in on meek John Fiedler and his blonde wife at the run-down motel , giving him a piece of their mind because they take him to be Astin ; Young’s intermittent visits to his shrink – eventually , he brings up Grant and Day’s problems but the psychiatrist thinks the patient’s in a gay relationship , culminating in a great fade-out gag at the very end when he meets Young on the street and the latter’s overseeing ‘their’ baby ! Incidentally , this was an atypical assignment for director Mann since he was usually an exponent of realistic dramas . By the way , of Grant’s latter-day comedic work , I recently acquired FATHER GOOSE ( 1964 ; which I’ve yet to watch ) and WALK , DON’T RUN ( 1966 ) ; furthermore , I may also get my hands on HOUSEBOAT ( 1958 ) . As for Day’s genre efforts , I have MOVE OVER , DARLING ( 1963 ; the remake of an old Cary Grant vehicle – MY FAVORITE WIFE [ 1940 ] ) , THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT ( 1966 ) and CAPRICE ( 1967 ) , all of which are still unwatched , as is THE THRILL OF IT ALL ( 1963 ) which might soon be likewise added to my collection .
395850	2483625	52478	4.0	Ringo's Seven Shooter	This rather average western rode into the sunset after one season . As another reviewer said this was the height of the television western era and the airwaves were filled with them . Dick Powell's Four Star Production Company gave us Johnny Ringo . What I remember best was Don Durant as Johnny Ringo having a pistol that fired seven shots , a shotgun shell came from a barrel beneath the one where the six bullets in the revolving chamber came from . That was one handy gimmick especially to those who were counting Ringo's shots before facing him down . When I saw the first Dirty Harry movie where Clint Eastwood dares the punk to try his luck , I immediately thought back to the short lived Johnny Ringo series . I still do whenever I see Clint as Harry Callahan . Ringo got far better than he deserved in this series , in real life he was something of a punk himself in the outlaw trade . He was found shot to death at the age of 32 , probably done in by Wyatt Earp and / or Doc Holiday . Don Durant went nowhere after this series , but Mark Goddard played a young trick shot artist who became Ringo's deputy . He of course went on to Lost in Space if you consider that a step up . Still Johnny's seven shooter was quite something to see .
485540	1416505	71402	7.0	Everyone has a little Paul Kersey in them .	Would the world be a better place with more persons like Paul Kersey around ? Who knows . But either way , everyone should be able to recognize themselves in the actions Paul Kersey takes . Even though its ruthless and violent , you still understand him and cheer for him as well . It distinct this movie from other ' revenge-flicks ' and is the very reason why this movie has grown a bit into a Charles Bronson classic . I like how the movie handles its story . It doesn't try to glorify Paul Kersey's actions but it does make them understandable . Yes , the violence is pretty brutal but it all serves a purpose in the movie and becomes necessary for the forming of the character . Basically this movie is just your average action movie revenge flick but with more realism added to it . It helps to make " Death Wish " an original movie , even though the story and concept itself is far from anything new or original . The story is slowly told and it takes its time to develop . The movie is perhaps even an essential ' 70's viewing , since its a one of a kind movie , in which a normal every day guy turn into a ' sidewalk vigilante ' after his wife is killed and his daughter raped by a couple of thugs ( one of them played by a very young Jeff Goldblum in his very first screen appearance ) . But lets be fair . the movie is far from a perfect one . The movie has a typical experimental like ' 70's style , especially in its cinematography , that is interesting to watch but it adds very little and works distracting at times . The movie is also told very simple at times and some of the sequences even feel amateur like , to be honest . The story itself also feels extremely far fetched and unlikely . I mean , literally every time Paul Kersey goes outside he walks into trouble . He gets mugged several times and he encounters other thugs on numerous occasions . It's highly unlikely all , even for in a city like New York . The acting on the other hand is good . It's probably mainly thanks to Charles Bronson that his character works so well for the story . I also really liked Vincent Gardenia in his role . He brought some much needed comic relief and gave the story some extra flair and depth . A simple movie that mainly thanks to the original way it handles the story and characters , works out extremely well as a brutal action flick . Even though flawed , still an essential ' 70's viewing in my opinion .

430581	1173088	75005	10.0	A great supernatural thriller , undeservedly bashed over the years	" The Omen " was included in a recent book I read of THE 1000 MOVIES YOU MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE ! - ironic since fellow IMDb user Theo Robertson claims it was included as an entry in a similar book titled THE 50 WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME . I've always really liked " The Omen " and , like Theo , think it is superior to " The Exorcist . " It's more chilling and freaky and subtle . There isn't any fake pea soup here , either . Which isn't to say that " The Exorcist " isn't any good - but it hasn't fared as well over the years . " The Omen " is just really good . It was released the same year as Exorcist if I'm not mistaken and Gregory Peck gives a fine performance . The part where a character's head is lopped off and rolls across a street in slow-motion , and then director Richard Donner cuts to a whole new sequence , is really chilling and bizarre . It's that sort of eerie unexplained stuff that makes this , in my opinion , superior to a lot of the other stuff out there - i . e . many other trashy supernatural flicks that don't hold anything against this .
551868	989035	156391	7.0	Fairly strong and involving for a television movie . . .	Jean Smart is a tower of strength as married mother of two who follows a hunch one afternoon and tracks her husband of 20 years to a hotel room - - where he's cozily wrapped in a white terrycloth robe and making chit-chat with a strapping man in a matching towel . His secret's out ! Of course this is all cliché by now , and some viewers will bemoan that fact and give up right there , but the TV film " A Change of Heart " addresses these issues with a lot of forceful emotion and realistic exchanges . There's hurt , and anger , and tears , but it doesn't sink into sap . The male lover isn't given any dimensions - - and seems to have a great home of his own , so why were they meeting in a hotel ? - - and the teenagers involved are tiresomely belligerent , but Jean Smart is the acting centerpiece here and she does the movie a world of good . Her speech to the board of directors where she and her husband work is flawlessly handled , and her bravura spirit at the end will give a lot of viewers hope . A good actress can do that .
555940	1406078	338297	4.0	Salamanca is beautiful	Is it necessary for this director to load up this film with so much political messages that for audiences outside of Spain are meaningless ? If the Spanish directors could take a chill pill with their " oeuvre " they would be much better off . Take a look at one of some of the best of the current ones : Pedro Almodovar and Alejandro Amenabar , just to mention a couple , they make films that are accessible , light , entertaining , and at the same time are commercially successful . What is the sense to knock the spectator dead with situations only familiar to the Spanish that confuse the viewer . ? If the director would have heard the public's comments after this film was shown at the annual Spanish film festival at the Walter Reade in New York , he would have taken the next Iberia flight to Spain ! Talk about unevolved people : that crowd ! Not only that , no one had a clue what the main conflict in the film was . And these are the so-called intellectual minds that attend basically all the films that are presented . The best part was the way the camera captures the majesty of Salamanca in all its splendor and beauty . The story and the execution of it were as baffling to me as it was for the rest of the audience . It's a waste to have people like Miguel Angel Sola who had a stellar career in his native Argentina , act in this piece , or not even give Margarita Lozano or Antonia San Juan an opportunity to shine .

Chaplin's sense of timing was wonderful , as always . Wholeheartedly recommended .
439280	1617546	140040	4.0	Not Good , But Good Enough	Even by the standards of the era , this was not a particularly good cartoon . The drawings are poor , the animation is limited , the characters are ill-defined and the story is not particularly amusing . But there is one thing you can say about Paul Terry's cartoons : he was able to make them on a small enough budget to be able to continue chunking them out for forty years , something that his bigger , better financed competitors in the field couldn't manage . Bray eventually went out of cartoon production , made industrial films and lived off the Bray-Hurd patents . LeCava and the others at International were there as part of Hearst's attempt at what is called , nowadays , brand extension : take the comic strips , which are popular and make movies out of ' em . Barre went out of business entirely . It took Koko the Clown and Felix the Cat to show what cartoons could actually do : show us a universe entirely different from our . But should you look at this one ? Maybe . Terry , just by his survival , is an important figure in the field . It might help you understand the economics of animation , which like other branches of film , is commercial art . Or you can just skip it .

558706	2626332	77413	10.0	One of the best !	Peter Ustinov portrays Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot , traveling on board a steamer ship down the Nile on an interrupted vacation via the murder of a socialite who has offended the entire world it seems , and has been deemed a " leach on the edges of society , " to quote one of the characters in the movie . Assisted by David Niven , he must sleuth out the instigator of this interruption before all the ship's passengers end up dead . One by one , they are being knocked off to cover the evidences of the original murder . Fine performances by all involved , but hats off to Mia Farrow ! Possibly the most brilliant performance of her career . Stunning . Absolutely stunning . An all-star cast delivers an all-star performance in this top row production . The scenes were deliberate and well planned , the scripting was marvelous , the dialog was funny where it should be and intense where intended , the costuming was marvelously period , and the direction was without peer . But it was the scenery , the settings , the sets and the props that made me love this film . Set in Egypt of the 70's , you can see the Sphinx before it was blasted by 30 more years of sand , bombs and fighting . You get to climb to the top of the pyramid of Khufu in Giza , see the Karnak Temple in Luxor , the Dendara Temple is featured in the background shots of several scenes . You are shown parts of the Philae Temple ( temple of Isis ) , and the Abu Simbel near Aswan ( built by Ramses the Great to celebrate his victories and his beloved wife , Nefetari . Lovely images of the Nile , its people and the surrounding areas . Ustinov being one of my favorite Poirot's over the years , I rank this movie at least equal with the Murder On The Orient Express , though I think more money and time were wrongly dedicated to MotOE . Had Ustinov portrayed Poirot in MotOE , it would have been my favorite . There isn't a moment of wasted film in this movie . Every scene gives you some insight into these well-developed characters . Watch for the scene where Bette Davis is " mooned " by the local children ! The scene towards the very beginning of the movie , between Maggie Smith and her " Lady , " is hilarious . Absolutely side stitching , if you can appreciate the dry , British sense of humor . Top row movie , with top row casting , direction , screenplay and SCENERY . Take an Egyptian vacation in your living room . This masterpiece gets a solid ( a rarity ) from . . . the Fiend .
366556	3109237	433409	5.0	Interesting , but flawed	- Liberia : An Uncivil War is a sometimes interesting , sometimes shocking , but sometimes flawed look at the last days of the Civil War in Liberia in 1993 . One of the directors was embedded with the rebel group LURD , while the other spent his time in the capital city with the government and the people . The portions of the movie that focuses on the rebels is fascinating . More than of few of the rebels appear to be little more than boys . Their training appeared to be all but non-existent . Yet , the commitment to the rebel cause was obvious . - The portion focusing on the government was just as interesting . The images of civilians being slaughtered were horrific . It was amazing to watch some of these people attempt to go through life as if a battle wasn't taking place a few miles away . The one glaring weakness with this portion of the movie was the lack of in-depth coverage of the government's forces . Whether the filmmakers weren't afforded access or they just failed to report on the army was not made clear . What was clear was the fact that the army wasn't any more prepared or organized than the rebels . - My biggest complaint with the film ( and I'm sure I'll get negative votes for this ) was what I perceived to be an anti-American bias on the part of the filmmakers . At every possible opportunity , America was shown in as negative a light as possible . I understand that these may only be perceptions on my part , but that's the way I saw it .

They have to decide , in the end , which twosome is preferable . What seems like a million other characters move in and out of the story , all focused around Ms . Allyson . Some of the characters are interesting and recognizable , some are not ? all become tiresome , eventually . It does sound , like others have commented , that Doris Day sings one of Allyson's songs ( early-ish in the movie ) .

437629	306861	47834	10.0	As Pertinent As Ever	The inhabitants of ANIMAL FARM - sorely distressed and downtrodden - unhappily trade one form of dictatorship for another . George Orwell's wise fable comes alive in what is supposedly Britain's first animated feature . The tale of totalitarian treachery is well told with stark visuals highly reminiscent of Soviet poster art of the 1930's . Not meant for children , this is a cartoon geared for grownup appreciation . It should be pointed out that Orwell wrote his satire after returning from a sojourn in the Soviet Union , much disillusioned by the evil & corruption he saw there . He wanted to express his views in the form of a fantasy and , hence , ANIMAL FARM was born . So , Farmer Jones is a symbol of the Czar , Old Major is Marx , Napoleon is Lenin , Snowball is Trotsky & Squealer is Stalin . The other creatures are symbols of the Russian people . The ending of the film , which is different from the book , is strangely prophetic of the events which would start to unfold in Eastern Europe in 1989 . Gordon Heath narrates the film ; all of the animal voices are performed by Maurice Denham .
368355	2707735	38452	6.0	" One small wind can raise much dust . "	Three former convicts have served time in States Prison together . At one time or another , each has been convicted of bank robbery based on fingerprints found at the crime scene . Charlie Chan's hunch is that the fingerprints were forgeries , and the victims were all set up by the real thief . Only one of the three is still alive , and he's just been arrested for the latest bank heist . If you're keeping score , " Dark Alibi " is the eighth installment in the Monogram Studios series of Sidney Toler Charlie Chan films . Benson Fong is Number # 3 Son Tommy ; and after a one film hiatus ( Red Dragon ) , Mantan Moreland is back , this time sharing equal billing with Ben Carter . The two reprise their " Pidgin " English escapades from " The Scarlet Clue " with three different conversations that are the comedic highlights of the film . As usual , there is a lot of misdirection with the introduction of the suspects , but one good clue comes with the identity of States Prison inmate # 8251 - Jimmy Slade , a fingerprint file clerk . But rather than being the master criminal , he winds up being a victim , as does his wife , known to us as Miss Petrie . It's interesting how many times the same gimmicks are repeated in the Chan movies . Back in the 1940 film " Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise " , Chan throws a coin to test the hearing of a man who claims he's hard of hearing . He does it here as well , and again uncovers the subterfuge . As we've seen before , the mastermind behind the bank robberies and the murders is revealed at the end with no fanfare or buildup , only the convincing explanation by Charlie Chan himself . The film almost had me though , I thought the warden was in on it ! For a Monogram , this is a fast paced fun film , made even more enjoyable by the Moreland / Carter dialog . It's a good enough reason by itself to watch " Dark Alibi " .
484674	1416505	82817	6.0	Promising beginning and a good ending but a weak , underdeveloped middle part .	The movie starts well and promising . Initionally the movie seems like a cool , simple , typical ' 80's action flick , with some well known actors in it . However as the movie progresses the pace is gone and the movie gets filled with underdeveloped plot lines and characters . Luckily the movie re-finds its pace toward the ending , which helps to make this movie still a watchable and good one , for the genre-fans . I think that the main problem with this movie is that its too short . Because of this nothing in the movie really fully gets developed , such as Sylvester Stallone's character's relationship with his ex-wife or who exactly was Peter Hartman , who seemed like a good and interesting enough character but unfortunately was highly underused and developed in the movie . He walked around without a real purpose despite the fact that he could had been a so much more relevant and interesting character for the movie and its story . Also they could had made the whole hunt of DaSilva ( Sylvester Stallone ) on Wulfgar ( Rutger Hauer ) so much more exciting , tense and spectacular . An hunter who hunts a hunter . Instead now their hate toward each other feels unfounded and perhaps even silly and unlikely at certain moments . Yet the tree main characters of the movie are still quite good . The two cops played by Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee Williams form a nice and credible duo and Rutger Hauer perfectly plays a villainous cold-hearted terrorist . Hollywood needs more villain actors like him , it would make so many movies so much better . Its definitely true that the presence of this tree fine actors uplift the movie and help to make this a still slightly above average one . The whole plot line of a ruthless , professional terrorist causing mayhem in New York is quite original ( at least for its period ) and works refreshing and help to make this movie quite an original action-flick , although his motivations still remain a bit in the dark and shaky to find it all credible enough . But of course the movie works well enough as mindless entertainment , though it perhaps could had used some more and bigger action sequences . The movie has ' 80's written all over it . Movies from the ' 80's don't have the greatest visual style and also mostly always have some horrible ' 80's music . This movie is unfortunately no exception on this all . All in all its not a bad action flick and it will most likely please the genre-fans , also thanks to the presence of ' 80's action icon Sylverst Stallone and villain expert actor Rutger Hauer .

This film is all about Nolte , a babe , and his gang of expert thief assistants who assemble to rip off a Monte Carlo casino under the watchful eye of the cops . This well crafted flick features a cosmopolitan cast , a crisp location shoot on the Riviera , a cleverly convoluted story which gets busy and stays busy , attention to detail seldom seen in movies , and a good musical score . Recommended for anyone into heist flicks but don't expect much else . This tight little drama is all about the heist . ( B )
436811	9938570	59311	9.0	Incubus	Kia ( Allyson Ames ) is a succubus working for the God of Darkness who is bored with luring already lost souls to hell . She wants to be a major factor in the Dark Lord's legion and thirsts for the desire to turn a pure soul to the dark side . Kia's sister Amael ( Eloise Hardt ) , warns her that doing this might be a very bad idea , but she is determined to carry it out . The challenge she hungers for becomes quite great when she chooses Marc ( William Shatner ) , a man who is deemed heroic by a warning Amael who says he saved several men from a fire without any fear of death . Marc's faith in God is strong . When Amael sees that Kia has fallen in love with Marc , she sees an opportunity to turn Marc over by abusing his sister Arndis ( Ann Atmar ) by calling an incubus ( Milos Milos ) to harm her . This film is truthfully about good versus evil , an age-old theme which never tires because so many difficult stories spurn from it . In this film , Marc will have to overcome a lot of adversity because the evil side are nefariously sneaky in causing great harm to your emotional state , challenging your will of purity at it's core . On the other side , Kia is shown as a woman of pure evil who finds love and acceptance from a pure man she can not seem to separate from . The film is very , very good . . better than I possibly could imagine . It plays like a feature length " OUter Limits " episode and I was kind of hoping it would be that way . It has eerie , darkened black and white photography and the music is creepy . The way it is shot is also a plus . . a lot of talented people came together to make this film . The novelty of it being in Esperanto does increase the film's cult status , but it's the overall ominous mood and the way the characters are lensed for which I'd say try this little recently restored gem ( actually the restoration was produced by SCi-fi Channel ) .
406857	865972	91825	8.0	Truly dark and eerie HK horror obviously inspired by the work of Lucio Fulci .	Tom Lau Moon-tong directs this grim horror film about playboy photographer Mo Hsien-sheng , who while on a shoot steals a grotesque statue from an abandoned temple . That night , he gets drunk with model Shu Ya and the two wind up in the sack , passed out . In the middle of the night , a creature emerges from the statue and rapes the sleeping model . When she wakes up the following morning , she has no memory of the encounter . Later , when she learns that she is pregnant , she has Mo , who has since shacked up with another woman , take her to the abortion clinic . Yet when the procedure is about to take place , the fetus leaps out of the womb and slays the doctor and nurse . Months later , just before Shu Ya is about to give birth , she's killed in a horrible car accident . During the ensuing autopsy , the fetus again leaps out of the womb and runs for the hills . Meanwhile , Mo learns that the statue contains the ashes of a baby whose father killed it in an unlikely cure for asthma . " The Rape After " is loaded with plenty of dark and creepy atmosphere of impending doom . It reminds me a little bit " The Beyond " and " City of the Living Dead " . The zombies are Fulciesque and the autopsy of the charred corpse of a pregnant Shu Ya will surely give some of you nightmares . Not a great deal of gore , but fans of bizarre HK horror films should be pleased . .
442914	819382	103074	3.0	All Men Are Brutes	Susan Sarandon is a delight as always , with her exopthalmia and perky nose . Geena Davis , in her first big role since her appearance in " The Accidental Tourist " is also good , and yummy in a toothy sort of way . The movie is fun to watch but it's silly in a desperate kind of way , slapping each other's palms and going " Wheee ! " as they sail off together into the Grand Canyon . ( The photography is sunny and splendid . ) More important than the performances , more important than the photography , more important than anything else about the film is that it is a perfect illustration of a sociological point - - It is impossible to have bonding without an enemy . People not only bond WITH one another but AGAINST others . ( Anyone into social psychology should check out Muzafer Sherrif's classic " Robber's Cave " experiment before seeing this flick . ) That's why the president's hooper rating always soars after a national crisis such as a terrorist attack . Suddenly our bonds with each other as " Americans " become more important than internal differences in regional or political viewpoints . This principle goes unspoken in the film . How could it possibly be articulated ? We would find ourselves sleeping with the enemy . But the message is there , covert as it is . There isn't a truly sympathetic male in the movie . Harvey Keitel is a relatively benign authority figure , but he is distant and powerless to do do anything other than his duty , which is evidently to put them in a position where they feel they need to turn into part of the scenery . Michael Madsen tries to be understanding and helpful but - - MICHAEL MADSEN ? ( How about Timothy Carey ? ) His looks , his demeanor , lightly rasping voice , his smoking , belie his dialogue . We recognize the face of the beast when we see it . That's why Costa-Gavras was nailed by critics for casting the sympathetic looking Yves Montand as a CIA-sponsored torture instructor in " State of Siege " . The husband is a stereotypical idiotic patriarchal male . A hitch-hiker , smooth and apologetic and cute , turns out to be a thieving moral idiot when his glands are satisfied . A would-be rapist is a greasy gargoyle . A truck driver is something out of the barroom scene in " Star Wars . " The flaw lies not so much in the movie , which is filled with breezy chatter and is exhilarating , and not in the script either . The deeply disturbing aspect of this motion-picture event is the audience's and the critic's response to it . What - - ultimately - - is there to applaud about a movie that tells us that the two genders are by nature or by fate enemies of one another . That one is oppressed and exploited by the other ? And that the resolution of the conflict lies not in negotiation but suicide ? If that were true , there would be no audience around to clap when Thelma and Louise do their joint nosedive . Yes , it has brio and leaves you feeling amused and happy most of the time , but it leaves a sour taste afterward . In the end this is a tragedy , not the comedy it was meant to be .
492025	3280905	587503	7.0	Interesting variant on D . O . A .	While not one of the best episodes of GET SMART ( I miss Smart's chief enemy , Siegfried - Bernie Kopell - too much when he's not about with his assistant Starker ) , this episode always remained memorable to me because of the central plot - a take off on Edmond O'Brien's film D . O . A . If you recall that film , O'Brien is fatally poisoned , and spends the last day of his life finding out who did this to him , why , and killing that person in retaliation . Here the victim is Maxwell Smart , given a slow acting poison by KAOS , and tracking down ( in typical Don Adams'methods ) his killer . It turns out that ( instead of dear Siegfried ) the KAOS agent is a health club manager named Hercules , played by John Fiedler . Fiedler does have the only bottle of the antidote , and Smart is determined to get it . But he is determined to even the score with Hercules as well . He manages to pour some of the same poison into Hercules ' heath juice before he drinks it . When Hercules learns that he too has drunk the poison ( and more of it than Smart did ) he and Smart both reach for the bottle of the antidote to drink the contents first . As you can guess , Max wins the odd final arm wrestling battle . I take it that the writers named Fiedler's character " Mr . Hercules " not only because they planned to have a small man like Fiedler play the part , but as a joke at the then noted body builder and health club entrepreneur Charles Atlas . If so , I wonder how many people today would catch the connection there .
516741	1132073	283026	10.0	Very good movie !	The Swimfan is dandy ! It is a different teen movie ! The acting was pretty good by the cast including Dan Hedaya and a very good score by John Debney ! This film in My opinion doesn't deserve the bad comments it has received because it is entertaining ! If you want a different teen movie then look no further because the Swimfan is your movie !
520806	1162550	315755	1.0	what's the point ?	No clue why this is listed on this site , but it is and I review pretty much everything so here goes . This is just Aki's dream segments for the Final Fantasy movie all edited together in a row . Why anyone would watch it is beyond me , the ( few ) people who like the movie will just watch the whole movie again and the people who didn't like the movie could care less about this . It's so bizarre that they put this on the special edition . I mean what was the point ? Were they trying to get more financing or what was the deal people ? ? As it is I just can't give whatever this is a passing grade .
482989	1293485	368891	4.0	Better than expected , but that's not saying much	To be honest , I did not want to see this movie in the theater . To me , it looked like another treasure adventure film that I've seen one too many times . And it was . . . sob This had the Indiana Jones Mummy Goonie type of feel that you could only get from those movies alone . Of course , there is always a villain that is greedy than the pure hero . Of course there is a well , in this case not so goofy side kick . And there is always the sassy hot girl that because likable at the end . Sounds familular ? It should ! Indiana Jones , The Mummy , and The Goonies ! They've been ripped off . This is an OK film , and a little better than what I was expecting when my parents rented it , but a good film to watch ? Nope .
492591	3280905	46054	8.0	The Curse of the Duries	It is generally conceded today that Robert Louis Stevenson's two greatest works are the unfinished novel WEIR OF HERMISTON , and the completed THE MASTER OF BALLENTRAE . The latter story ( published in 1889 ) is centered on a filial rivalry and hatred that lasts literally until the death of the two brothers involved . Ballentrae is an estate in 18th Century Scotland , and the chief heir is James Durie . On the surface he is an easy going , fun loving type . When the 1745 Jacobite revolt under Bonnie Prince Charlie occurs , the Laird of Ballentrae is in a quandary . As a Highland Laird , he has to show he is a supporter of the ancient royal house of Scotland ( the Stuarts ) that Prince Charles represents . As a man who knows what the Hanovarians are like , he dare not fully come out as a supporter . So he hedges his bets . He has James go off to fight for the Stuart cause , but keeps his younger son Henry at home . Henry is not a fun loving type - he is a quiet , business-like type , who does not make friends easily . So James goes off , and time passes . He is eventually reported as dead . Henry immediately becomes the heir to the estate . But suddenly James returns , and willingly brings troubles with him . The British government does have a price on his head , and if he is found on the estate the Duries may be imprisoned and their wealth taken away . Yet the old man insists that Henry do what is right for his older brother , and James keeps reminding Henry that by rights he is " Master of Ballentrae " . What happens , of course , is a disaster . To begin with , it slowly comes out that James may have declared for the Stuart cause , but he never showed up to fight for that cause . In short he acted like a loud mouth , attracting the anger of the government but then showed he was a coward . Not a total coward ( where his own interest is involved ) but one who won't put himself out for others when the chips are down . Secondly it turns out that his fun-loving activities are coming home to roost - he's had an affair , and left an illegitimate child . This , of course , means that the family has to support the bastard child . Moreover , Henry has married the woman who would have married James under normal circumstances . He is now trying to unofficially regain her attention . This proves too much for Henry , and leads to one of the best passages in Stevenson's writings - the duel between the brothers in a darkened room . It ends with Henry believing he killed James . Would that he had . James persecutes Henry and his wife for the rest of the novel ( the father eventually dies of shame after learning how James was so cowardly at Culloden ) . The novel eventually goes to New York ( then a colony ) where both brothers meet up and meet their joint destiny . This review of the story does not go into Henry's character flaws ( he is a money grubber in the end ) . Stevenson never did make a better completed novel , even though there are elements of the improbable in it . The story was made into this 1953 film , probably the last good movie Errol Flynn had the lead in that was a swashbuckler . The ambiguities and moral lapses of the two brothers are not used here ( Henry is played by Anthony Steel , and he is far too young here for the role ) . James ' opportunistic streak , and his non-appearance at Culloden is not in the film - he shows up at the battle . Indeed , he meets Colonel Francis Burke , an English Jacobite ( Roger Livesey ) who becomes his one ally and friend in the novel . In the film there will be other allies . Mervyn Johns plays the family servant MacKellar , who narrates the actual novel ( but not here ) , and sees the flaws of both brothers all too clearly ( although he ends up sympathizing with Henry ) . Lord Durrisdeer , the father of the brothers is Finlay Curray . The cast is generally quite good . But the excellence of the story is dropped and replaced into a tale of misunderstanding , and how a universal dislike of the English manages to keep the family together . Stevenson would have been amazed and hurt by what was done here . I am willing to give the film an " 8 " for it's good points , mostly the performances ( in particular Livesay's chemistry with Flynn ) . But I miss the tragic element of the novel . To properly appreciate the novel , if one can't read it , try to catch the television version made with Michael York and Richard Thomas and John Guilgud back in the 1980s . It too changed the end , but it stuck closer to the spirit of hopeless competition and hatred that Stevenson concocted in his masterpiece .
571020	4248714	91419	8.0	Little Shop of Horrors	Based on the 1960 film , apparently only filmed in two or three days , this is the remake based on the Howard Ashman Broadway musical , directed by Muppet veteran Frank Oz ( In & Out , Bowfinger ) . Basically nerdy Seymour Krelborn ( Rick Moranis ) wants to help improve business at the florist he works at for Mr . Mushnik ( Vincent Gardenia ) , and get the interest of his co-worker who he has a crush on , Audrey ( Ellen Greene , reprising her Marilyn Monroe inspired Broadway role ) , by placing an unusual and unidentified plant in the window to attract customers , and it works . The plant , Audrey II , seems to have a craving on blood , and grows after every feeding , to the point when it speaks / sings for itself ( with the voice of The Four Tops ' Levi Stubbs ) for his supper . Luckily Seymour finds the perfect victim he can chop up and feed to Audrey II , sadistic dentist and Audrey's on-off boyfriend Orin Scrivello ( Steve Martin ) , Mr . Mushnik is also victim to the plant after witnessing Seymour's chopping up . Seymour questions Audrey on why she loves him , and it's not for the success of the plant , and not long after she discovers the truth , nearly to her demise , Seymour decides it's finally time to put a stop to Audrey II . Also starring Tichina Arnold as Crystal , Tisha Campbell-Martin as Chiffon , Michelle Weeks as Ronette , James Belushi as Patrick Martin , John Candy as Wink Wilkinson , Bill Murray as Arthur Denton and Christopher Guest as Customer # 1 , Miriam Margolyes as Dental Nurse and Stan Jones as Narrator . The Doo-Wop songs ( of course all performed by the actors themselves ) are all very catchy , in particular : " Grow For Me " , " Somewhere That's Green " ( spoofed hilariously in Family Guy ) , " Dentist ! " , " Feed Me ( Git It ) " and the Oscar nominated " Mean Green Mother from Outer Space " . With a similar feel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show , this is a fantastic special effects and star-filled black comedy horror musical . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Original Score for Miles Goodman . It was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Very good !
439219	1617546	840305	2.0	Showing My Age	The Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner is a long series of unfunny comedians who are more interested in seeing if they can drive anyone off stage than in actually saying or doing anything that can be remotely construed as funny . Now , a Roast is not meant to be polite . A roast can and should run the gamut from rough to appalling . But watching Andy Dick trying to gross out everyone by running his tongue over anyone who would hold still for it is not funny . Watching Farrah Fawcett try to get through her canned jokes without breaking up is not funny . As for Lisa Lamparelli , her best line was noting that her career was dead , but she could still get a gig on Comedy Central doing roasts . Indeed she can , so long as there is no requirement that she be funny . Nor do any of these ' comedy ' bits have anything to do with William Shatner . There is much about William Shatner's career that could have served a roast well : Shatner's egotism , his spreading waistline , his propensity for overacting . Yet no one was terribly interested in the subject of William Shatner . Largely , the ' comedians ' were interested in themselves and the apparent belief that all transgressive behavior is funny . Most of the barbs consisted of " You're fat and have no talent , William Shatner , now I'm going to vomit on the stage , and I love you , Bill . " The one good routine starts the show , with a rcorded ' telephone conversation ' between Shatner and Leonard Nimony , in which Shatner urges Nimoy to show up , saying it will be fun , and Nimoy saying ' Don't do it . ' My hope that , after an amusing start , something good would turn up some time in the proceedings was never justified for more than fifteen seconds . Nimoy's routine , alas was correct . Shatner stayed for the entire show . Don't you .
463987	2467618	281176	8.0	I'd put this in the top 10 of all the Icelandic movies I've seen , . . .	Actually , the above comment is VERY misleading , as this is perhaps the 3rd movie I have seen from Iceland . In fact , because we get so few Icelandic movies her in the US , I made it a point to give it a try , as I wanted something different . Overall , I liked this movie , as the acting was good and the plot took lots of little twists and turns . This movie is an excellent example of a film that is difficult to predict and has characters who are quirky but not one-dimensional cutouts . Freya is a worldly woman who is returning home to Iceland after the death of her husband . She moves in her extended family and from then on , the movie is seen , at times , from the eyes of her little cousin who resents having to share her home and bedroom with Freya . It's obvious early on that Freya isn't going to just blend in - - as she arrived with 7 trunks clothes - - all in the latest fashions . While she turns the heads of many men , the rich guy who initially shows her the most attention goes from hot to cold . It seems she is from a working class family and he is rich ( at least by Icelandic standards ) , so it appears that he drops her cold . Later , though , it seems that despite his family pressures to ignore her , he returns and marries her . Life with this rich guy at first seems great , though difficult due to his bitchy mother . Then , the relationship begins to sour and Freya moves back with her family . The weak husband begins drinking ( and whoring ) and begs and then threatens the pregnant Freya to return . The final time he approaches her he is particularly violent and the scene is literally MISSING . I like that touch because you aren't sure exactly what happened . What happens next is just something you'll have to find out on your own , as it would definitely spoil the movie to talk further about the plot . Apart from the script and acting , the movie has very catchy mid-50's American music and a few VERY explicit sex scenes that make this movie a bad choice for the kids . PS - - this movie reminds me of the Oscar-winning ANTONIA . Both are strong feminist films , but Mávahlátur doesn't seem nearly as preachy and is a better film .
482007	1293485	55614	10.0	Perfection on film	West Side Story , one of my personal favorite movies of all time and without a doubt my favorite musical . Why do I love this film so much ? Because of it's high energy , great actors , terrific songs , awesome dance numbers , and beautiful love story . As an updated Romeo and Juliet story , we visit the streets of Manhattan , two gangs of different ethnicities , Tony and Maria , the two fall in love by are torn apart by the gang's hatred for each other . Sounds pretty basic , not to mention we have dancing gangs , they don't really fight , they just dance , yeah again sissy , but not in this story ! The crew and cast put their heart and soul into this film and it truly paid off as this is the best picture of 1961 . In the streets of Manhattan the Jets , led by Riff , and a rival gang of Puerto Rican immigrants , the Sharks , led by Bernardo begin to rumble . The police arrive and tell the " hoodlums " to get off the streets . The Jets discuss challenging the Sharks to one last all out " rumble " , that will decide who gets control of the streets , and they will deliver the challenge to the Sharks at a dance later that night . Riff decides that his best friend Tony , a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local store , would be the best member of the Jets to present the challenge to the Sharks . When Riff visits Tony at the store , Tony initially refuses Riff's request to meet with the Sharks , but he later changes his mind . At the bridal shop where she works , Bernardo's sister , Maria complains to Bernardo's girlfriend , Anita . Maria believes that Bernardo is overprotective , never allowing her to have enough fun . Bernardo arrives and takes her to the dance . At the gym , the Jets , Sharks and girls are greatly enjoying themselves , but the rival gang members and their girlfriends remain apart . Tony and Maria see each other , become infatuated , almost going into a trance-like state and begin to dance , then embrace in a kiss . Bernardo pushes them away from each other and orders Maria home , and tells Tony to stay away from his sister . Tony discreetly visits Maria outside the fire escape at her home and they confirm their love . The next day at the bridal shop , Maria sings to her coworkers about how happy she is . Tony arrives to see Maria , she pleads with Tony to prevent the rumble altogether , even if only a fist fight is planned , and Tony promises to do so . At the the rumble , the fight begins between two rival gang members . Tony arrives and tries to stop the fight , but is met with ridicule and mockery from Bernardo and the Sharks . Unable to stand by and watch his best friend be humiliated , Riff angrily lashes out and punches Bernardo . Drawing their knives , Riff and Bernardo fight each other , their duel ending with Bernardo killing Riff . Enraged , Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife ! Tensions are now at an all time high as both gangs want to get even and Tony and Maria's love is being torn apart by all the hate . West Side Story is truly a special movie , I personally don't know why it's not on the top 250 IMDb movies , if you are going to watch a musical this is the one that I always recommend . We don't get musicals to this big scape any more , they don't have the same heart as West Side Story had . The actors are absolutely incredible , it's so weird when I watched a documentary on this movie , apparently Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer hated each other , but I guess that must help during the lust scenes because hate and love are practically in the same category when it comes to passion . But the true stars of the film are Rita Moreno as Anita and Russ Tamblyn as Riff , great performances from the both of them . West Side Story is a movie that has no flaws what so ever and anyone who wants to argue me on that , feel free to send me a message .
505355	2911571	472465	7.0	very eerie and creepy	This is filmed all in one take from a supposed dash-mounted camera in a police vehicle . There's something going on involving meteorites landing in an isolated park area in Lawton , CA . The officer at the wheel , one Brick Bardo ( ! ) is reporting back to base about what he's seeing on his patrol , and he stops to look for someone who has abandoned their truck & is attacked & " possessed " by something from this other man . He then proceeds to get back into the car & go back to where he saw two kids from the prom that were parked , and infects the boy but the girl grabs the car & takes off . Most of the rest of the film is the girl in the car , trying to get out of the park & facing all sorts of eerie scenarios as more and more people become infected , while she speaks with another deputy back at base . Reports from the deputy are that the townspeople seem to be infected . Really , there is not a lot to this film as far as action , gun play , or anything TOO wild , but it's pretty creepy in general and it's quite eerie and claustrophobic as the trapped girl goes round and round in the park looking for a way out that doesn't seem to exist . Comparisons to Blair Witch are probably inevitable but that film is either a love it or hate it film , and if you liked it you'll probably like this . But it's not quite the same thing , not at all . An interesting experiment from Albert Pyun . And by the way , the name " Brick Bardo " ( the aforementioned officer ) is the name used by Tim Thomerson's character in " Dollman " . .
508453	453068	171363	5.0	One of the best examples of how to NOT make a horror film	Ex-Cinematographer ( of Die Hard ) and now director Jan De Bont struck gold with Speed and while it wasn't gold , Twister wasn't a suck fest . This is . I sat in the theater whacting this and thinking too myself , is anyone getting scared by this ? I mean I understand that it could be scary to some , back in 1920 . But now , immune systems have been built up againt horror films , and while they don't have to be gems to be good , they shouldn't have to sucfk like airplane toilets anyway . The plot ( with very little to do with the original and the book ) involves a lady who can't sleep , so she goes to a big house hosted by a doctor ( Liam Neeson ) and with 2 other insomniacs ( Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones ) to find out why they can't sleep . But the doctor has more secrets that the others know , as the house becomes alive . Some good visuals can't make up the fact that it is really dumb , with a horrible script , not good performances and stupid scares ( the only one that was fair , which makes this film pass , is when Wilson looses his head ) . Definately not for sharing .
532694	70535	120616	4.0	Sufferin ' Sphinx !	Shoulda called this turkey " The Dummy " . Wasn't anything but a cheap knockoff of " Raiders of the Lost Ark " , with nowhere near the tension and excitement . This junk was merely ridiculous , stupid , silly , idiotic , etc . I've rarely been subjected to such cornball dialogue combined with extremely bad storytelling as I was with this tale . The excellent computer trickery could do nothing to save this putrid bilge .
366015	3109237	67341	7.0	" Do you like my new dress ? My new old dress ? "	Jessica ( Zohra Lampert ) is a troubled woman . Recently " cured " of a psychological disorder , she and her husband , along with a friend , move to a large house in the country . Upon arriving , they find a mysterious , but agreeable woman named Emily ( Mariclare Costello ) living in their house . They invite her to stay and things seem to be going smoothly . But Jessica has started having visions again . She sees people who aren't there , hears voices , and discovers dead bodies . No one else notices anything . Is Jessica going mad ? Or is there something more evil going on ? For the most part , Let's Scare Jessica to Death works as a slow-moving , atmospheric horror film . If you need chainsaws rumbling , masked killers , and blood spurting , steer clear of this one . But if you're a fan of slow-burn , subtle horror , you will find a lot to enjoy . There are moments in Let's Scare Jessica to Death that go beyond creepy and enter the realm of downright scary . The film has the feel to it of something just under the surface you can't see , but scares you nonetheless . Images like Emily coming out of the water in her wedding dress are classic . And , overall the film looks great ? and by great I mean suitably dark and foreboding . The acting is generally good with Costello giving a standout performance . A lot has been written about Lampert ? some going so far as to call her performance " Oscar Worthy " . To me , she seems to be trying a bit too hard . Yeah , we know she's a nutcase , but that doesn't excuse some of the over-the-top histrionics . Get over yourself ! Notice I wrote that Let's Scare Jessica to Death works " for the most part " . I have never cared for the ending . The finale takes the film in a completely different direction from anything that comes before . For lack of a better work , it's too obvious . It's as if someone demanded something more overt in the ending . A more subtle , mysterious ending would have fit better with the atmospheric feeling that the film had been building . Instead , we're given an ending that really harms what is otherwise a classic horror film .
556582	1406078	319524	6.0	Read Sarah Dessen's books , they're better !	This is a film that goes in all directions without any logical explanation . At times the film seems to be taking place in Sunny California , and then there's snow ! Are we in the East , or was it in the West ? At any rate , Clare Kilner , the director , moves her characters in strange ways . The mother is a hysterical woman who can chastise her daughter , but then does exactly the same thing . The father is a fool who exchanges the mother for a " bimbette " . The older sister is involved with a foolish boyfriend , the only reason she sticks with him is a future life of luxury . Halley is about the only normal person in this family , but then , she almost loses it all by falling in love with a boy that seems to be trouble . Oh well . . . Mandy Moore , as Halley , is about the only reason for watching the movie . She is what holds it together . Allison Janney , an actress that's always good , is not as effective in this thing , at all . Neither is Peter Gallagher , as the talk show host father . What irritated me the most is the phony situation between the older sister and the rich boyfriend . Talk about mismatches ! They'll probably be in front of a divorce judge in the near future . Oh heck , one has to keep on trying until one gets it right , isn't that the idea ? SpoilerSpoiler Is it a new trend to present pregnant teen agers whose boyfriends have died ? This is the second film I've seen about the subject , the other one being " Due East " , in which there is a similar situation . Of course the message seems to be , have the baby and then get on with your life , even if the baby is given up for adoption , which is a cop out . If the young woman decides to go ahead , stick to the script and raise the child !
417034	663392	412798	7.0	Scary Film	This film will give chills up and down your spine not because of horror or blood shed , but just the simple location in Wales , UK and a mysterious cottage and naturally , a Light House . Demi Moore , ( Rachel Carlson ) , a successful author of mystery novels wants to have a different location away from everyone and finds this very spiritual place , or you could say a purgatory for the living dead . Rachel encounters Henry Ian Cusick , ( Brian ) , " The Gospel of John " , ' 03 who seems to know a great deal about the Light House and its history and has some fun burying a Mother-0f Pearl sea shell in the sand as a symbol of lasting love . There are many twists and turns in this film and it is very well produced and directed . I must say , I have never seen Demi Moore looking so young and very sexy . Great entertaining film , enjoy .
477903	463200	104684	8.0	Almost one of Woo's best	Nothing new plot-wise ( male loyalty , police undercover , gun smugglers ) but the acting was good , the dialogue credible and some of the most amazing and very violent stunts I've ever seen in an action film . They make the film worth watching . But , it's too cruel for me to say I enjoy it . . . SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! Towards the end a large bunch of babies are put in danger - - one or two are almost gunned down ! Also , a bunch of crippled people are shot to death by the bad guy . Why ? We already knew he was a psychopath . . . we didn't need this ! It's an upsetting scene - - needless and sick . Those two elements make it somewhat unpleasant to watch . Take those scenes out and you got a great , kick ass action film !
513687	3223254	403198	10.0	An Homage to an Island of Understanding	KEY WEST : CITY OF COLORS is a fine little documentary meant by its creator Talmadge to focus on the unraveling of a 1 and mile long Rainbow Flag down Dylan Street connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico . The beauty of the film is not just the documentation of this 2003 event marking the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Rainbow Flag by Gilbert Baker , it is also a celebration of the little island of Key West and the people who live there . Creator Talmadge Hayward presents a brief history of this isolated island at the far southern tip of the United States ( closer to Cuba than to Miami ! ) , showing old photographs of the sponge business , the piracy , the smuggling , and the ever present cohabitation of African Americans , Hispanics , famous artists , wealthy , poor , gay and straight citizens . He then spends a great deal of the film in interviews with many of the residents - some lifelong some newly transplanted - who explain in warm and simple terms why this oasis for acceptance is an oasis for human kind . The colors are rich , the parade of the flag unfolding from ocean to gulf is magnificent and inspiring , and the message of peaceful coexistence serves as a goal for us all . Grady Harp

418264	1609079	268604	8.0	Shut up , Henry : she's NOT perfect !	Each year since 1973 , the American Film Institute have given their Lifetime Achievement Award to a prominent film star or director . The choice of whom to honour has been motivated by various factors . . . such as whose name will sell the most tickets . The guest of honour must be alive , and must be willing to attend in person and give an acceptance speech . The first four annual awards were given to male recipients : in 1977 , the AFI decided it was time to honour a woman , but their committee's first choice ( Katharine Hepburn ) refused to accept the award in person , so they gave it to Bette Davis ( who apparently didn't mind being second choice for an award based on gender ) . Cary Grant had a standing offer to receive the AFI award , but he was never willing to make an acceptance speech and so he was never chosen . The year after Bette Davis accepted her tribute , the AFI chose to honour one of her co-stars , Henry Fonda . An ongoing flaw of the annual AFI tributes is that they tend to load the dais with big film names who don't really have anything to do with the guest of honour ( but who will bring in a few TV viewers ) rather than people who actually worked with the guest of honour . This Fonda tribute avoids that problem . There is a large and impressive roster of speakers here : first-rank stars who actually worked with Fonda . There is an especially heartfelt tribute from James Stewart , who knew Fonda before either was famous : they were classmates at Princeton , and then roomed together as struggling actors in New York . ( Fonda won their friendly rivalry by getting a Broadway role before Stewart . ) Ron Howard , not yet a big-shot director and major Hollywood player when this tribute was produced ( but a TV star on ' Happy Days ' ) offers some memories of co-starring with Fonda in an obscure TV series , ' The Smith Family ' . As usual for the AFI tributes , there is a generous helping of film clips from the guest of honour's career . Some of the inclusions are obvious choices , such as Fonda's brilliant ' I'll be all around in the dark ' set-piece from ' The Grapes of Wrath ' . Also as usual , the choice of clips is partly determined by which people are on hand to give tributes . Lucille Ball is one of the speakers here , so we get a clip of one of her films co-starring with Fonda . Fair enough , but the choice is a strange one . I've never liked Lucille Ball , but I was deeply impressed by her dramatic performance opposite Fonda in ' The Big Street ' , in which she played a vain selfish nightclub performer who exploits a waiter ( Fonda ) after she becomes paraplegic . Instead of a clip from this film - - in which Fonda and Ball both gave excellent performances - - we get an unfunny clip from the bland ( but hugely successful at the box office ) comedy ' Yours , Mine and Ours ' . Even the producer of that pabulum - - Robert Blumofe ( who ? ) - - gets to speak a few words here . From the star-filled crowd on offer here , it looks as though everybody in Hollywood knew Hank Fonda . Well , everybody but one . Fonda and Katharine Hepburn both spent decades in Hollywood , but they met for the FIRST time when they co-starred in ' On Golden Pond ' , two years after this AFI tribute . Another person who's not on hand here is William Wyler , who directed Fonda and Bette Davis in ' Jezebel ' . Fonda and Wyler had both been married to actress Margaret Sullavan ( Fonda had her first ) , and there was no love lost between the two men . The AFI tribute always ends with a speech by the recipient . Fonda introduces his own family ( trophy wife , film-star daughter Jane , cult-actor son Peter , granddaughter Bridget ) and then offers some memories about his own father , a newspaper editor , who influenced young Henry . ( I wish that Fonda had mentioned the interesting trivium that his drama teacher , back in Omaha , was Marlon Brando's mother . ) Next , Fonda tells a rambling yarn about his amateur debut in a high-school play . His father attended the performance , and when several people told Fonda pere how inept an actor his son was , the father replied : ' Shut up , he's perfect ! ' This gets a laugh from the AFI audience . With a smirk , Fonda then goes on to mention that people have criticised his daughter Jane for her political activities . He lets this thought linger for a moment , and then he adds ' Shut up , she's perfect ! ' . . . to great applause from the left-wing Hollywood crowd attending this event . Sorry , Hank , but your daughter gave aid and comfort to the enemy when America was at war , and she has never offered any real apology to the servicemen whom she dishonoured , even while her workout videos reap profits from the capitalist system she criticised . I've long considered Henry Fonda a great actor but a political idiot , and this tribute is diminished by the agenda of his acceptance speech . But the stardust quotient is so high , I'll rate this tribute .
433721	2171244	438938	8.0	World AIDS Day	In a small recognition of World AIDS Day , I spent some time watching this outstanding documentary about the origin of the disease . There is no debate as to where and when HIV-1 originated , but there has been some discussion as to exactly how . Was it naturally occurring , or did we somehow do it ourselves ? This film answers that question and leaves little doubt as to the origin of these terrible disease . The answer will certainly surprise you and cause you to wonder about the way we are all treated as guinea pigs in the name of science and profits .
484404	1416505	19702	7.0	The first Hitchcock talkie is a memorable one for different reasons entirely .	I have the feeling people call this movie a great one just because it's made by Hitchcock . But truth being told , the movie really isn't among the greatest in its genre . Even the master himself obviously still had some learning to do . No disgrace , since this is the first ' talkie ' from the master of suspense . Well , not exactly entirely a talkie in my book , since the movie is still mostly shot in silent movie style . Sound came available during the making of this movie , which was reason for Hitchcock to re-shoot certain parts of the movie with sound . It doesn't exactly give the movie a very consistent style and makes the editing look clumsy at parts . The movie is a bit of a drag at points , with also some overlong pointless dialog and long shots . The movie does luckily get better when the suspense kicks in and the movie turns into a real thriller . But soon again the movie starts to tend to be overlong at points . It also restrains the movie its story and keeps it rather simplistic . The movie gives you the feeling it had more potential in its story really . There are some great , almost artistic like looking shots within the movie , which still makes this a certainly better than average one and also more interesting to watch . it's a very creatively put together movie , with also some great camera-work , lighting and use of shadows . Of course the museum chase at the end of the movie is the highlight of the movie . It's a greatly directed sequence that is great looking and constructed . It showed Hitchcock's talent and was a premise of things to come . The actors certainly aren't among the greatest of their period . Their excuse could be that this was their first talkie as well though . It's not the most exciting Hitchcock you'll ever see . Even as an early thriller and for 1929 standards it isn't among the most exciting or best ones but it's a movie worth watching for its artistic creativity .
470077	1532177	114558	6.0	Cameron Vs Bigelow	! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I can imagine Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron marching into the excutive offices with a movie idea . One of them pitches an ideas driven movie about virtual reality while the other pitches an old fashioned character driven thriller about a couple of corrupt cops wanting to get hands on evidence that will implicate them in a crime . The studio exec stratches his chin , can't decide what movie he wants then has a sudden brain wave of merging the two plots into the same movie . That might have happened , it might not have happened but watching STRANGE DAYS I had the gut instinct that somewhere along the line someone had engineered the two above plots into the one movie . All through the running time I felt there were two screenplays trying to escape . Needless to say STRANGE DAYS starts to collapse under the weight of its ideas . There's also several more unnecessary sub plots such as racial politics , rising crime levels and the mechanics of the music biz which by the end don't feel like they really belonged in this movie . Not only that they also add to an overlong running timeI awarded STRANGE DAYS . What stopped me from awarding it lower marks is the amount of kinetic energy director Bigelow has infused into the film , it's by no means an unwatchable thriller despite its flaws and with a cast featuring Fiennes , Basset , Lewis , Sizemore , D'Onfrio and Fitchner at least there's some well known character actors on display . Saome complained at the time that Cameron should have directed the movie instead of Bigelow , but there's not much wrong with the directing unlike the script which was written by CameronHow's this for a VR plot . A corrupt state frames a heroic and noble subversive by implanting memories of sexual abuse into the minds of children thereby framing the hero and jailing him as a child molestor . A deeply disturbing and adult premise for a sci-fi drama , and one that had been done before in the opening episode of BLAKE'S 7 . So you see the rather weak premise of STRANGE DAYS in comparison ?
385823	391152	64866	8.0	In loving memory of Gillo Pontecorvo , who died last week	Pontecorvo's followup to The Battle of Algiers , and probably his second most famous film . That's probably mostly because of the film's star , Marlon Brando , but the movie itself is quite good . It's a little slow , sometimes a little difficult to follow , and it hits us with no less than three third act speeches ( a speech a character makes near the end of the picture which more or less explains the film's themes , just in case you missed it ) . At it's best , though , Burn ! is a powerful treatise on the pains caused by colonialism . The story centers on a British man , Brando , who goes to the Portuguese-run island of Queimada in order to provoke a slave rebellion . He preaches freedom to the slaves , but his real aim is to get control over the island's sugar . A decade or so after the original rebellion , the natives aren't co-operating with the British anymore , and Brando returns to overthrow their leader ( Evaristo Márquez ) , whose career he fostered . Brando is , as expected , excellent . I wouldn't rank this among his very best performances ( the inevitable Italian dubbing always makes all performances a tad awkward ) , but it's definitely second tier Brando . This might be the most despicable character he ever got to play . I also liked Márquez , who often gets criticized for giving a wooden performance . The cinematography is beautiful , and Ennio Morricone provides an amazing score ( I love the song that plays after the revolution ) . Gillo Pontecorvo's direction is very good . In fact , I think I slightly prefer this to his acknowledged ( in my opinion , overrated ) masterpiece , The Battle of Algiers .
395799	2483625	70438	6.0	Disaster Film On A Budget	The Neptune Factor deals with some scientists who live and work out of an undersea lab in the Atlantic Ocean . One fine day while their bosses , Walter Pidgeon , Yvette Mimieux , and Ernest Borgnine are up top , an earthquake occurs and the lab topples over into an underwater crevice . Though an atomic power submarine could stay down there indefinitely the problem is that crevice is way too small for one of those big boys . A smaller type submarine able to withstand the pressures of the very deep is needed and that's where Ben Gazzara and his ship the Neptune come in . As disaster films go The Neptune Factor is small potatoes special effects wise . It's a Canadian production and I've seen Hollywood come up with worse films spending a ton more money than was done here . The special effects such as they are , are merely movie films of some ordinary species of marine life blown up several times their size , because these are the creatures the crew finds down at depths that man hasn't been before . It's beautiful undersea photography just like a trip to Marineland . It's a no frills production , no subplots of any kind , no social interaction of any kind with the crew , just do the mission and go home . That's why it was given a G rating when first released . If you love Jacques Cousteau , you'll love this film .
437150	306861	27376	10.0	A Gypsy Adventure With Mr . Laurel & Mr . Hardy	Two gentle eccentrics raise THE BOHEMIAN GIRL kidnapped by gypsies , unaware of her noble birth . In evaluating this film it is important to understand that it is very different from the result first planned by Hal Roach . The mysterious and scandalous death ( murder ? suicide ? accident ? ) of the leading lady late in 1935 caused extensive reshooting & reediting by the nervous Studio . Although Thelma Todd is still given third place billing , her participation has been slashed down to virtual insignificance . What a waste . This was the lovely & talented Miss Todd's final film , she was a credit to herprofession and she deserved better treatment . This probably also accounts for the abrupt cuts & scene transitions which plague the production . As a result , Felix Knight's obvious role as romantic lead was also truncated and he is left with but one short appearance , singing a melodic ballad . This is also a shame , as he was a fine young actor and he never received another good chance to become a successful movie star . The main attractions , Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy , never falter . They are hilarious even when sitting and doing nothing . Playing puckish pickpockets , they get to involve themselves in a fair amount of physical activity , which gives the viewer another opportunity to marvel at Stan's inventiveness and Ollie's remarkable grace & dexterity . Stan's latest finger trick and his attempt to siphon a barrel of wine into bottles , along with Ollie divesting a foppish nobleman of every last valuable accouterment , stand out , but only as gems among treasures . Two of the great character actors from the Boys ' films of the past appear with them again . Formidable Mae Busch , making her final appearance with Stan & Ollie , plays Hardy's spectacularly unfaithful wife and suspicious little James Finalyson comes in at the end as an officious captain of the guard . OUR GANG cutie Darla Hood is darling indeed as the purloined infant . She grows up to become pretty Jacqueline Wells ( an obvious replacement for Miss Todd ) . Former matinée idol Antonio Moreno plays Miss Busch's paramour , while elderly English actress Zeffie Tilbury brings life to the small part of the Gypsy Queen . Irish prodigy Michael William Balfe ( 1808-1870 ) composed the 1843 operetta upon which the film is based . Many of the words of the songs , especially when performed by the Gypsy Chorus , are unintelligible . However , it is good to hear the wonderful old solo ballads " When Other Lips " & " I Dreamt That I Dwelt In Marble Halls " beautifully sung .
428888	3079504	70423	4.0	Great monsters in a slow brooding mess	Donald Pleasence is a mad doctor trying to mix plant and animals , who only succeeds in causing weird mutations . Aiding Pleasence is Tom ( Dr Who ) Baker who is a deformed owner of a circus side show . Slow dull mess that has a great cast , cool effects but a pace that will put you out . I've loved the photos I saw from the film over the years and was really looking forward to seeing the film at last . Boy was I disappointed as things seemed to be all talk and little action , even if the monsters look great and the circus side show sequence is fun . Despite my best efforts to stick it out to the end I finally had to break down and scan through some of the verbal nonsense . Worth a look if you like cool monsters and are are forgiving , for any one else I'd take a pass .
558963	2626332	92239	9.0	Harry Potter's faerie godmother	While I'm no fan of the TV series , I've always loved this movie . It teaches younger people to keep trying , no matter who says what . It teaches them that perseverance is more important than talent . Work at it , and keep working at it , and eventually , you'll get it right . Years after , when I was first exposed to Harry Potter , I couldn't help but think , " rip off . " There are SO many common points and characters that it seems blatantly obvious . But so many people don't seem to realize that all the key players of this work eventually made it into the HP cast of characters . Their sex may have changed , or the beautifully rich characters here may have been split into two less complex characters in the later work , but they're all there . Professor Snape and Professor McGonagal are obviously different sides / aspects of Diana Rigg's Hardbroom . Professor Dumbledore , an obvious male version of Miss Cackle . Harry is Mildred , and Ronald Weasley is Maud . Furthermore , Draco Malfoy can be found here , in the form of Ethel Hallow . Hardbroom gives Mildred nothing but a hard time in potions class , Miss Spellbinder ( Madam Hooch to the HP fans ) is trying to teach the first years how to fly , and they're all getting ready for a visit from Tim Curry's Grand Wizard ( the HP's Minister of Magic ) . While this group of young witches play terror tag rather than Quittich , and it is an all girl school instead of going co-ed , the obvious comparisons are staggering . Watch the Worst Witch for the movie , which started the whole visual magic revival . It rates an for being ORIGINAL from . . . the Fiend : .
498694	1355507	87262	6.0	Decent Stephen King adaptation .	Firestarter starts as Andrew McGee ( David Keith ) & his young daughter Charlene ( Drew Barrymore ) escape the clutches of some federal agent type guy's , you see a shadowy Governemt organisation called ' The Shop ' conducted some experiments on Andrew & Charlene's mother Victoria ( Heather Locklear ) who then got together , had sex & ended up with Charlene who as a result of the experiments is a pyrokinetic & can start fires by just thinking about it . Now the evil guy's & gal's who run The Shop want Andrew for his own telekinetic abilities & Charlene for hers , Andrew knows they want to conduct experiments on himself & Charlene for their own evil purposes & is determined not to let The Shop get hold of them . . . Directed by Mark L . Lester & adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name Firestarter is fairly mean spirited but watchable horror / thriller . The script by Stanley Mann which takes itself very seriously is at it's most enjoyable during it's first half when Andrew & Charlene are on the run which is when it is pretty interesting & relatively absorbing , unfortunately the second half of the film switches gears completely & it becomes evil scientists vs . Charlene & lets face it there was only ever going to be one winner . I'm not happy about the long sequences of Charlene making people burn to death , I'm sorry but I felt no sympathy for her as a character & the scenes of these people burning , whether they had done anything to her or not , were pretty strong & Lester certainly likes to dwell on their pain & the screams they make as they burn . I usually love exploitation & the nastier the better but these parts in Firestarter just didn't sit well we me at all & thought they were gratuitous & unnecessary . The character's aren't great , the dialogue is OK & I didn't really see why they wanted to capture Andrew & Charlene so badly , I mean whose bright idea was it to suggest they could control her anyway ? Ultimately what did they intend to do with her ? It moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't too boring but I doubt I'd want to watch it anytime again soon . Director Lester does a good job , the suitably fiery climax is pretty brutal as Charlene dishes out some swift & severe punishment . Apparently Lester replaced John Carpenter who was originally set to direct but after the critical & financial failure of The Thing ( 1982 ) , which coincidently is one of the biggest travesty's in cinematic history , the money men at Universal ' removed ' him from the project . I wouldn't call it scary , it's not particularly creepy or exciting either but it does have a certain sinister atmosphere . There are some strong scenes of people being set on fire & burning to death here , the special effects do a great job perhaps even too great a job as they come across as excessive . Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any . Shot in North Carolina & boasting a very healthy sounding budget of about $15 , 000 , 000 Firestarter has a very slick & professional look about it , it's well made with impressive fire effects & it has high production values . There's a surprisingly good cast here , Martin Sheen who took over from Burt Lancaster at short notice , Drew Barrymore who was riding high on the success of E . T . ( 1982 ) , coincidently E . T . was the reason why The Thing bombed at the box-office , George C . Scott complete with comedy eye-patch & Heather Locklear are all probably recognisable to the average film-goer . Firestarter is a decent enough time waster , it's an OK Stephen King adaptation , it has a good cast & some impressive fire effects but as a whole it's average with a predictable & lightweight story that ultimately goes nowhere . Followed by the made-for-TV sequel Firestarter II : Rekindled ( 2002 ) which brings the villain John Rainbird back from the dead somehow . . .
564663	102816	395413	8.0	A show that could never be anymore	If The Trap Door were to debut in 2006 then it would be low-grade CGI crap with no atmosphere or icky moments . What does that tell you about the current crop of PC-trash children's programming ? As it is , The Trap Door was an icon of 80s children's television . ' ooever knew that plasticine models could be so effective ? But it wasn't just that . The castle that Berk and Boni ( and the Thing upstairs ) lived in was such a brilliant , atmospheric set . The ' owling winds , the dead trees and the constant dark and fog really did add a lot to it . Berk was some kind of blue creature and was also a butler / servant to the ever-unseen cockney-voiced Thing , ' oo would always complain about the noise or being ' ungry . Whenever Berk would turn his back an ' orrible monster would creep out of the Trap Door in the basement . The Trap Door led directly into the catacombs beneath the castle where an infinity of worms and diabolical nasties dwelled . They'd cause no end of trouble for poor ol ' Berk . You'd think he'd learn to keep it shut . The theme song , despite sounding very 80s , was pretty damn cool too . One particular episode devoted its entire running time to an extended version of it . But that's one of my gripes . The running time was only 5 minutes ( barely ) for each episode , which was a bit annoying since it always seemed to end just as it was starting . It only lasted for two seasons for some reason . But even though they only made a handful of episodes , The Trap Door has remained popular for over 20 years and that more than you can say for children's TV of today .
407819	865972	98331	6.0	A marginally better than " Silent Night , Deadly Night Part 2 "	Dr . Newbury has saved the life of the hideously injured Ricky Caldwell . The doctor has encased his patient's explosive brain inside a Plexiglas cap , yet he has failed to revive him from his deep coma . In Newbury's attempt to reach the comatose victim's mind , he connects Ricky's brain waves to a gifted clairvoyant , Laura Anderson , who unexpectedly taps into the dark and twisted realm of his haunted dreams . Ghastly things begin to happen and detective Connoly ( Robert Culp ) , must fight to stop the dangerous experiment . " Silent Night , Deadly Night 3 " is a mediocre horror film at its best . The pace is horrendously slow , the script is terrible and the acting is weak . Still there are some interesting camera angles and the film is suitably interesting . The next sequel was a completely unrelated gorefest from Brian Yuzna , whose unusual vision ? often rejected by series fans ? was at least a change of pace . .
434605	2171244	1240076	9.0	Amazing episode	This was an amazing episode on so many levels . The suicide of one woman was unexplained until they happened to talk to another , who was also a bank teller , and discovered a link that was just incredible . I am not sure this is possible , but it made for a compelling and funny story . The husband who pulled his wife's tubes after eight years of suffering was touching , even as it mirrored the relationship of Grissom and Sidle , and the need that Grissom had for Sidle to break the relationship . But , the most amazing story was the woman who was murdered in an alley , and her " son . " When this all came out , it was a shocker that was not to be believed and an outstanding piece of creativity on the part of the writers .
429607	1173088	70666	5.0	Beardface	Review edited for IMDb due to word limit . See wiredonmovies . com for full review . " Serpico , " its many flaws notwithstanding , is far from being a terribly exciting motion picture . Granted , it is based on the true story of an incorruptible Italian-American cop named Frank Serpico who brought down an entire police precinct that was " in on the take . " But true stories aren't always warranting for great films . That's the primary reason Hollywood always spices stories up by inserting scenes that never occurred in real life and altering the facts . " Serpico " could have used a bit of altering . It's just not interesting enough to sustain its material for two and a half hours . Perhaps a ninety-minute movie would have done it justice , but its running time is far too long for such a film . But even then I could probably say it's a well-made film . Too bad it feels so sloppy and cheap . Let me briefly rephrase that in a nutshell : It's not a bad movie . It just could have been a lot better . Sidney Lumet should be ashamed . He should have fired the editor the first day on the job . Here we have many different scenes spliced together , in apparently random order , and an unbearably dingy audio track that plays during ( and over ) conversations ! Music is essential to all film , but it has to be used correctly . You can't just play a soundtrack throughout an entire motion picture . But Lumet doesn't even do that . He plays it in the worst spots he possibly could . It's as if he went through the entire movie , marked down each scene where there shouldn't be music in the background , then applied it . Even if you're going to burden the audience with music and dialogue blending together at the same time , at least make it good music ! Many scenes seem pointless and badly executed . Pacino is a standout but the rest of the film is a failure . The acting ( save Pacino ) is stiff and the dialogue is corny ( save Serpico's , but even his gets cheesy sometimes ) . It's as if everything were scripted by an author and just fed to the actors . Oh , wait , that's exactly what happened . My bad . Did all these people who claim this is the best police corruption film ever made witness the same mediocre blend of poor technicalities and acting and music that I did ? Did they not see the horrendous nature of the random interactions being spliced together with separate ones ? Did they not notice that every time a crucial character moment came around this really , really bad music started to play over the actors ' ? The plot is pointless because I've already delved into it - - a downtown police precinct is corrupt and they can't stand Serpico's morality . So they decide to plot against him and try to murder him . They fail . First we get Serpico being led away in a car . ( " He's been shot by a cop ! " ) Bloodstained and in a daze , we see Al Pacino's bearded portrayal of Serpico drifting in and out of consciousness . Then we get the non-introduced flashbacks to the beginning . But Lumet presents Serpico as a caricature , playing by all the rules and fitting snugly into a giant cliché . Al Pacino rises above these clichés , of course , with his hard-edged performance . But imagine how much more powerful it could have been if the director and scriptwriter had liberated him and set him free . Maybe we'd get a performance to equal that in " Scarface . " But alas , Pacino is simply overburdened with juggling these clichés and only manages to make the character somewhat realistic . Even then he goes through the same routines that all the clean characters go through . ( Even Sly made it more realistic in " Cop Land . " ) I saw a documentary once about the real Frank Serpico and what he did after the film was released . He turned into a hermit . He still looks the same , with his beard and all , but it'd be interesting to watch the film with him and have him point out all the things he actually did and said as opposed to what's in the movie . I'm not saying Serpico was corrupt . I'm sure everything is true . I'm sure he was a very nice and moralistic man . But there's a difference between being a moralistic man and a naive idiot like Serpico in the movie . Pacino makes him smarter than he appears on paper but read some of his lines to yourself and notice the sheer stupidity of it all . Pacino's performance is a knockout one , which is why " Serpico " gets a fair rating in my book and a weak recommendation . But it takes its time getting places , too many scenes are out of place , the music is more often distracting than not and the rest of the cast are insufferable . They could easily have brought down Pacino but he's too strong for that . He's a fighter , just like Serpico , which may explain why he took on the role . Too bad Lumet had to interfere with his performance . Too bad the music had to interfere with the dialogue . Too bad Lumet and the music had to be there at all . Just imagine what Scorsese could have done with this , and how liberating he could have made the character and his interactions . Here we just have a stone caricature of a real man , and it isn't too terribly impressive .
447054	1048771	346468	7.0	Star-studded even elevated by presence of Olivia de Havilland . . .	Despite the muted tone of the 75th Academy Awards , there were some outstanding moments and here are a few of the observations I care to make on the whole affair : 1 ) Adding not a bit of class to the televised event was CAMERON DIAZ , busily chewing gum and staring vacantly at some of the old-time presenters , as though she either didn't recognize them or didn't appreciate that they were a part of film history ; 2 ) ADRIEN BRODY giving a genuinely heart-felt acceptance speech , including the surprisingly passionate kiss for Halle Berry ! Talk about taking advantage of a situation , but at least he was honest about it ; 3 ) MICHAEL MOORE making a complete jackass of himself by taking the stage to receive an award ( for a non-documentary , by the way ) , and then erupting into a tirade against President Bush and the war that was greeted at first with abashed silence and then a round of well-deserved boos from the overwhelmingly liberal Hollywood crowd ; 4 ) OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND receiving a standing ovation and still radiating good health and classic loveliness even with silver-white hair as she presented 59 of the past winners . Among the missing : ELIZABETH TAYLOR , which was just as well considering her diamonds would have weighed her down , even if she was sitting in a wheelchair , and would have called for even more of a bodyguard atmosphere than usual ; 5 ) Among those who didn't look so well ( some even shockingly bad ) , were KARL MALDEN , JENNIFER JONES ( who looked like a wax figure ) , TERESA WRIGHT , GEORGE CHAKIRIS ( another wax figure ) , KIRK DOUGLAS , DUSTIN Hoffman , PATRICIA NEAL and CLIFF ROBERTSON . Although it was good to see a stage full of former winners , one couldn't help noticing how few of them resembled their former selves on screen . STEVE MARTIN did an okay job as presenter , easily rebuffing Michael Moore with a clever comeback line about the Mafia , but unfortunately veering into tasteless territory with his jokes about MICKEY ROONEY's age or the sexual ambiguities of stars like JACK NICHOLSON and others . I was especially impresssed with one of de Havilland's comments after observing that much had changed since the earlier times . " What hasn't changed , " she said , in her gentle tone , " is our love of the movies . They inspire us and help us through troubled times . " She's done so many Oscar shows as presenter ( not to mention winner ) and is always a reminder of how classy Hollywood performers used to be .
393461	2483625	35015	9.0	Trust Fund Baby Gets His Comeuppance	For his second feature film directorial effort Orson Welles assembled a lot of his Citizen Kane alumni , Joseph Cotten , Erskine Sanford , Ray Collins , and Agnes Moorehead , for this screen adaption of the Booth Tarkington novel The Magnificent Ambersons . He didn't bring Gregg Toland along to film the thing , but Stanley Cortez definitely learned how from Gregg as to what Welles wanted . The Amberson mansion sure looks like a lost relation to stately Xanadu and the same deep focus photography is present . And those fill the screen closeups and telling shadows , still there and used to great effect . Richard Bennett is the head of Amberson clan and he's got a lovely daughter in Dolores Costello . Joseph Cotten is the hardworking young man who desires her hand as do many . But he tries a bit too hard and she coquettishly rejects him and marries good and dull Donald Dillway . The have a son who she spoils rotten in the person of Tim Holt . Tim Holt as George Amberson Minafer would today be called a trust fund baby . The thought of work or some kind of profession is alien to him and he has an intense dislike for Cotten as much as he'd like the daughter he has from the marriage he made after Dolores rejected him . My favorite scene in the film is Holt with Cotten's daughter , Anne Baxter , in a carriage where Holt is telling her about his disdain for any profession let alone any manual labor . But while being a person of leisure as one in Holt's class is born to be , he'll use his money in various charitable enterprises to benefit the less fortunate . Sounds like a budding Michael Moore . Holt got great reviews for this part proving here as he did in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre that he was capable of being more than a B film cowboy . But that's where he returned to and probably of his own choice . Also about that time war service interrupted his career as well . Joseph Cotten belongs to that vanished race of gentleman players that used to grace the screen . They don't write parts for people like him , William Powell , Don Ameche , Ronald Colman , etc . But being a part of these two immortal Orson Welles creations assures him a place in cinema history forever . The saga of the Amberson family covers a slice of American social history from the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era . Besides the editing that Welles claimed butchered his film , The Magnificent Ambersons failed to find an audience in 1942 . America's entry into World War II was on most people's minds then . A story about a bygone era just didn't sell . Citizen Kane which also had a bygone era story was also about a guy still very much on the scene . All the controversy about William Randolph Hearst sold a lot of tickets for Citizen Kane . The Magnificent Ambersons certainly didn't have that kind of a built in publicity gimmick . Even with the cuts that Welles objected to the film still has great merit , a fine group of players telling a good story . Tim Holt got his comeuppance , but not quite the way he expected . Then again so did just about everyone in the cast .
518169	8239592	65446	9.0	A lovely and touching seriocomic Western gem	1908 . Scraggly frontiersman Cable Hogue ( beautifully played by Jason Robards ) gets left in the fierce Arizona desert to die by his treacherous no-count partners Bowen ( the always excellent Strother Martin ) and Taggart ( a splendidly nasty L . Q . Jones ) . Hogue discovers water in the middle of nowhere and starts his own business running a rest stop located on a well-traveled road . Director Sam Peckinpah , working from a quirky and colorful script by John Crawford and Edmund Penney , expertly crafts a winning blend of earthy humor and gentle lyricism with this funny , moving and thoughtful fable on redemption , second chances , and the last dying days of the wild'n'woolly Old West . Stella Stevens shines in one of her best-ever roles as Hildy , the brassy and beautiful whore Hogue falls in love with . Moreover , there are equally terrific supporting performances by David Warner as friendly , but lecherous itinerant preacher Joshua , Slim Pickens as amiable coachman Ben Fairchild , R . G . Armstrong as irascible banker Quittner , Peter Whitney as helpful benefactor Cushing , and Gene Evans as surly brute Clete . The sequence with Stevens and Robards singing the sweet duet " Butterfly Morning " rates as a definite delightful highlight . Lucien Ballard's lush , picturesque cinematography makes inspired occasional use of artful fades , dissolves and split screen . Extra props are in order for Jerry Goldsmith's folksy , flavorsome score and the catchy soundtrack of tuneful'n'twangy songs . A real treat .
446181	1048771	35916	8.0	Dreamy Faye and the genius of Busby Berkeley in vintage lavish musical . . .	Some of ALICE FAYE's close-ups in THE GANG'S ALL HERE convince me that Technicolor was made to show off the charms of certain actresses - - as Fox well knew with such beauties as Betty Grable and Linda Darnell under contract . Faye's blue eyes get all misty-eyed when she sings a ballad - - and when she's supported by someone like CARMEN MIRANDA for colorful contrast , well - - you can bet it's a musical worth seeing and hearing . In this case - - mostly worth seeing because of Busby Berkeley's magical treatment of all the musical numbers . Who can ever forget CARMEN MIRANDA and all those waving bananas ? ? ? Or the kaleidoscope effect of several top numbers in an imaginative use of color and camera effects , the kind that only Berkeley was a master of . The flimsy plot is strictly by the numbers and practically non-existent in a boy meets girl , boy loses girl , boy wins girl sort of way . JAMES ELLISON is a poor substitute for Fox's contract player John Payne , who must have been busy on another assignment when the cast was assembled . And PHIL BAKER is totally wasted . But it's not too much of a distraction when the gaudy splashes of color , music and just downright fun provided by Faye , Miranda , Eugene Palette , Edward Everett Horton and Charlotte Greenwood come to the fore . This is typical Fox escapism made for entertainment during World War II when the troops were all salivating over the Fox pin-up girls . Alice Faye is at her most attractive with her warm contralto voice showcased in a couple of hokey ballads and when she gazes heavenly toward some unseen spirit she practically melts the camera lens . She's luscious and so is the film . And if you're a CARMEN MIRANDA fan , you can't afford to miss this one . Her " Tutti Frutti " number is a knockout and Benny Goodman and his band provide solid musical back-up . Just don't expect reality to butt in at any point during the silly plot . Trivia note : That's ADELE JERGENS in the background of girls .
429426	1173088	177789	7.0	Stars - A Nice Satirical Family Comedy With More Hits Than Misses	" Galaxy Quest " is a bit of a mix between " Star Trek " and . . . well . . . " Star Trek . " It stars Tim Allen , Sigourney Weaver ( in a blonde wig ) and Alan Rickman as the crew of an ex - " Star Trek " - type show , who are contacted by real aliens who picked up the television show in space , thinking it was real . Allen and crew are taken to the alien space craft in space to help out the aliens with their problem - - a large grasshopper-looking creature and his band of baddies is trying to take over the ship , or something like that . I haven't seen this movie in a few years . So Allen and co . try to help out , but cause more trouble than anything , until the climax of the film - - that gets a bit long but is still pretty fun . The first time I saw this movie I really hated it . I'm not a " Star Trek " freak ; in fact , I don't believe I've ever been able to sit through a whole episode of the television show , much less the dull films . So I didn't really pick up on many of the film's gags . The second time , however , I had more fun , although I still missed out on some jokes because I'm not a " Trekkie . " The performances by all the actors and actresses involved is great . I'm not a fan of Weaver , but I suppose she did fine in this film . Allen is himself - - quite funny , but not over the top . My personal favorite , however , was Tony Shaloub , the comic relief - - even though the whole film is a comedy , he provided more of it . The whole idea for the film is pretty original , if a bit contrived , and there are good opportunities for jokes that are not wasted . Good potential carried through for a good film . " Galaxy Quest " isn't a great movie , but it's pretty funny and I enjoyed it . Stars - John Ulmer
493297	3280905	32926	8.0	Popeye Aids Switzerland's Hero	I find this an amusing cartoon , and it does show some of the things to expect in the Fleisher studio . There is the " in-joke " of the photo of the son of William Tell ( a former star at Paramount , which produced the Fleisher cartoons ) , and the way the characters are developed . The cruel despotic governor actually momentarily defends Popeye ( pretending to be Tell's son ) when Tell slaps Popeye for smoking . The governor , who is watching this hits Tell for slapping his kid ! Popeye rounds it out by knocking out the governor for hitting his dad ! ! It was of a series of Popeye cartoons where he met Sinbad , or Ali Baba and the 40 thieves , or Rip Van Winkle . Bluto was the villain in the first two of these , but was not in the latter or this one ( nor was Olive in the latter and this one ) . But they are not missed , as there was plenty of mileage to get out of the Tell story . Finally the townspeople resemble in dress and actions the characters in the " Gabby " cartoons , and in Fleischer's major flop , " Gulliver's Travels " . The townspeople were the best things about Gulliver - and they added to the amusement of the " Gabby " cartoons as well .
405566	2020269	79641	8.0	Klaus Kinski . . . Bringer of DOOM !	The first thing that should be made clear to every cinema-fan who considers watching Herzog's " Nosferatu " is to AVOID all language-dubbed versions ! To see the formidable Klaus Kinski is always a great pleasure , but to hear him talk in a dubbed voice is just downright atrocious and almost a crime against nature ! No matter how beautiful the cinematography and filming locations remain , seeing this film in a wrong language can simply ruin everything . That being said , Herzog's interpretation of the legendary Dracula story is a very , very strange movie ! This shouldn't surprise anybody , as this director ? as well as his regular protagonist Klaus Kinski ? upholds his eccentric reputation with every movie he completes , but still this is one of the weirdest projects in the history of the horror genre . Even though Bram Stoker's Dracula tale spawned a whole lot of different film versions , Herzog's film is a direct remake of the silent F . W . Murnau classic of 1922 . That film is generally considered as one of the all-time greatest genre classics and thus it was quite an ambitious and even perilous idea of Herzog to update it . The tone and atmosphere are very similar to the original film , meaning that Count Dracula is portrayed as a dismal and almost piteous creature that lives in total isolation and exclusively longs for some ( female ) affection . He is , however , the bringer of doom , forced to feed on human blood and always surrounded by an army of ravenous rats . Young Jonathan Harker , played by Bruno Ganz who recently startled the world with his mesmerizing performance of Adolf Hitler in " Der Untergang " , is assigned to travel to Dracula's remote castle in the mountains of Transylvania and present him the buying contracts for a house in Wismar . Upon seeing a picture of Harker's lovely wife Lucy ( that's right , NOT Mina ) , the Count gets obsessed with her image . He puts a spell on Jonathan and prepares his own journey to Wismar , accompanied by his army of rats that carry around the plague . It's most remarkable how , in this film version , Dracula's terror affects an entire town ! Not just Jonathan Harker and his wife Lucy suffer , but the coming of Nosferatu ( = bringer of plagues ) threatens the whole population of Wismar . The most intense sequences of the film involve long rows of people carrying the coffins of their departed family members or the increasing mass-hysteria among the last survivors . Other than for the fascinating modifications in the basic screenplay , " Nosferatu " is highly recommended viewing for the staggering photography . Werner Herzog's talented & detailed eye for beautiful landscape images widely surpasses every other horror director's visions and this is easily the artiest vampire movie ever filmed . Harker's journey through Transylvania , with its fog-enshrouded nights and uncanny mountain roads , is paralyzing to observe and the ominous images of Dracula's somber castle are equally impressive . Klaus Kinski is indescribably brilliant , as always , and thus far the ONLY actor whose charisma alone sends cold shivers of fear down my spine . His performance , along with the photography and not to forget the masterful use of music , all contribute in making this one of the most unique horror films of the 70's decade . It has some flaws too , but they're mere details and really insignificant compared to all the great aspects .
385589	391152	24034	8.0	Wonderful	If only there could have been more musical and dance numbers ! All of them ( not counting practices ) occur at the very end of the film , and there are only three of them there . Luckily , the non-musical parts were really good , too . The plot was just a pretty standard behind-the-scenes of a play movie . It actually reminded me a lot of two films about plays that I have just seen recently , Micheal Powell's _ The Red Shoes _ and Tim Robbins ' _ Cradle Will Rock _ . While the plot may be a bit common , the dialogue is exceptionally good . It is snappy and witty and clever at all times . Also , the ensemble cast was extremely good . I love Dick Powell . He's not in this film too much , but he's perfect in every scene he's in . I was first introduced to him in the guise of Phillip Marlowe ( and I am among the small group of people who consider him the best incarnation of Phillip Marlowe ) , and he's just as great in the genre which brought him his fame . This is also the first movie that I've ever seen involving Bubsy Berkely , and I have to say , WOW ! ! ! Those musical sequences are ingenious ! One thing I find funny , though , is that , if you think about it , the audience who would be watching the play from below wouldn't be able to see any of the fancy designs the dancers make with their legs ! Too bad for them ! I give this film a !
437761	306861	22259	10.0	Busting A Marriage With Mr . Wheeler & Mr . Woolsey	A pair of shady Nevada lawyers become involved in the uproarious divorce proceedings of a strident PEACH-O-RENO . Comics Bert Wheeler & Robert Woolsey , who starred in a string of popular comedies from 1929 to 1937 , return with a funny look at the peculiar goings on - - divorces & casinos - - in the Nevada city of Reno . The Boys ( Wheeler is the little fellow with curly hair ; Woolsey is the skinny guy with cigar and glasses ) toss out one wisecrack after another in this Pre-Code concoction . The film's hilarity reaches its zenith ( or nadir , depending on the viewer's sensibilities ) during Wheeler's extended drag sequence , which includes an uproarious dance number with Woolsey . Disguised as a very merry widow , Wheeler challenges Charles Ruggles in CHARLEY'S AUNT ( 1930 ) as the best female impersonator of the early talkies . Young Dorothy Lee , Wheeler's very frequent cinematic love interest , is Kewpie Doll cute as always , but she's really given very little to do until quite late in the film when she perches on a grand piano for her requisite song with Bert . Getting better lines is Zelma O'Neal as Lee's blunt talking sister . The girls ' divorce-seeking parents are nicely played by Joseph Cawthorn & Cora Witherspoon . Other performances of note are given by Arthur Hoyt as the Boys ' nervous Nellie secretary ; Mitchell Harris as a gun-happy gambler intent on plugging Wheeler ; and Sam Hardy as the conniving judge who presides over the chaotic courtroom scene which ends the film . Movie mavens will recognize corpulent Harry Holman in an uncredited role as Witherspoon's outmaneuvered divorce lawyer .
478787	463200	71508	8.0	Sick , stupid , FUN	Udo Kier plays Baron Frankenstein who makes beautiful male and female monsters . He wants them to mate but the male monster has the head of a man who wanted to become a priest . . . so he can't " perform " ! I'm not kidding - - that's the plot ! I saw this when it was released in theatres in 3-D back in the early 80s . It was the R rated version ( they said ) . Turns out it was the X rated version ! Quite interesting . The story is stupid , the dubbing atrocious but the movie is so over the top ( in acting and plot ) it's plenty of fun ! In 3-D ( which was excellent ) you have every disgusting thing you can think of thrust in your face . Rats , a severed head , intestines , a human heart at the end of a spear , etc . etc . It's not disgusting , just silly . And the movie was so stupid you just kept watching in amazement to see how bad it was going to get . My favorite line is when the Countess is woken up from a deep sleep and screams " How dare you wake me up ! You know I have insomnia . " ( ! ! ! ) A laugh a minute in this one . Too bad all the 3-D prints seem to be gone - - it was LOTS of fun that way .
406263	2020269	964539	6.0	Cadavers aplenty in the Body Shop !	I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and got hooked on " Pathology " right from the very first minute , even though it was for a very stupid and even completely wrong reason . The opening sequence , still before the credits appear on screen , depicts a handful of medical students disrespectfully toying around with their research cadavers . They poke their already rotting flesh and use them as puppets for their obscene and perverted role plays . It's sick ! It's twisted ! It's morally incorrect ! I LOVED that ! Especially since most horror movies nowadays lack this sort of offensive tastelessness and moral incorrectness . Surely this bizarre intro will already temper the enthusiasm of most viewers , but for other sick puppies like myself it might be the beginning of a very promising new horror sleeper hit . And generally speaking " Pathology " is a satisfying horror film . The concept is intriguing , the movie is well-directed and fast-paced , there are several unexpected plot twists and there's an admirably large amount of engrossing make-up effects and nauseating imagery . The wholesome is eventually brought down by implausibility and sheer illogicalness , but let's come back to that later . The story introduces the brilliant pathology student Ted Grey , who joins the class of the eminent Dr . Quentin Morris and comes into contact with a bunch of equally gifted but totally obnoxious and wayward fellow students . The group , led by the charismatic Jake Gello , drags Ted along into their wild nights of drugs , alcohol and partying . They invent a sinister game where each one commits a random and so-called perfect murder in turn , only for the other members to try and discover the victim's cause of death . When Ted's beloved fiancée moves into town he wants to quit the game , but obviously Jake Gello won't let him . " Pathology " is a wild , eventful , exciting and really brutal . Director Mark Schoelermann literally attacks us with compelling autopsy speeches and non-stop gruesome images and for a long while this combination works so effectively you don't even bother about all the questions the plot raises . Then suddenly you make a realization . Why do the pathology students commit these grueling murders again ? For kicks ? Because they can get away with it ? I'm sorry but that's nearly not enough reason to explain their actions . To commit the murders they commit , you'd have to be a natural born monster and natural born monsters don't waste seven years in med school first . And now that we're on the subject , I have a couple of friends who're studying to become a doctor and it's a mentally as well as physically exhausting duty , with a lot of on-the-job training and nightly research work . Supposing pathology studies are at least something similar , I don't think these people have time for extra-curricular activities like drinking and adultery , let alone the carefully planning , executing and solving of perfect murders . Oh well , a certain absence of logic and reason is forgivable in a horror movie , I guess , especially when most of the other crucial aspects are above the average quality level . If you like bloody images that are intended for strong stomachs , a fair portion of sleaze and hardcore shock endings , I would definitely recommend " Pathology " .

452827	15896852	33627	6.0	Sauerkraut in Canada	One of the more interesting World War II propaganda films , due to outstanding writing ( by Emeric Pressburger ) , direction ( by Michael Powell ) , and performances . The opening credits and sequences may be confusing . The story involves six Nazis making their way from Hudson Bay ( in northeastern Canada ) to cross the " 49th Parallel " ( the United States / Canadian border ) , after their U-boat ( submarine warship ) is damaged . At the time the film was made , the U . S . would have been a " safe " ( neutral ) country . Also , the film does not " star " Leslie Howard and Lawrence Olivier - rather , the lead actor is Eric Portman ( as Hirth ) . Mr . Portman and crew do very well in their roles . The most interesting aspect of the film is that the Germans are written to include a " good " Nazi , who wavers in his support for the Fuehrer . The most satisfying of the film's loosely threaded stories involves the " good " Nazi bonding with a Canadian immigrant settlement , led by Anton Walbrook ( as Peter ) . This , and the segment with Raymond Massey ( as Andy Brock ) , is where you'll find the filmmakers delivering their most palpable ( and eloquent ) sermonettes . The film is too episodic for its own good - one story , with more focus on Portman's crew , would have sufficed . 49th Parallel ( / 41 ) Michael Powell - Eric Portman , Leslie Howard , Laurence Olivier

Riggs is confronted by Cole who tells him that she should have been informed of the lead he had on Travis . after they kiss and make up , the three go out to try and find Travis . . . . ignoring the laws of diminishing returns , Silver and Donner up the ante by having the largest building explosion ( at the time ) as the opening . but five years after the original , the film loses it's rawness and thrilling edge that made the original one of the best films of the eighties . the plot is straight out of any straight to video film of the same time , so the makers focus on set pieces and one liners , which are still as funny as Blacks original script , but i feel that by the final third of the film , the writers were running out of dialogue , as the phrase ' son of a bith ' is uttered over twenty times , and sadly becomes unintentionally funny . the film also suffers from stereotypical disposable henchmen , and unnecessary subplots . watching the directors cut makes the film more enjoyable and a little more human , and explains why some of the theatrical version had hideous editing . but Gibson and Glover still have the magic and this is still one of the best action movies of the early nineties ( along with the last boy scout ) . but with references to the second movie rife throughout , this still shows respect to the franchise and is a solid Friday night action flick .
519790	1162550	427848	3.0	Tony , you go from Candyman to . . . . . this ? ? ? ! ! ? ?	Bad ass phychopath , Shadow ( Candyman's Tony Todd ) is executed , but not before starting a full scale riot resulting in many prisoner deaths . Twenty years later the prison is now a womens ' penitentiary . Focusing on the new inmate , Solitaire ( Carla Greene ) , a tough girl who Shadow was planning to sacrifice when she was a baby , it isn't long before the zombies of the prisoners led by Shadow himself are out to finish what he started . This cheesy b-grade horror flick might have had a little promise in the beginning and I like Tony Todd , but once the film gets to the women's prison and focuses on it's inhabitants , the film becomes simply dreadfully lame , not even the shower scene or other nudity could save it from sub-par mediocrity . The film does pick up in the last 30 minutes or so , but not enough to make it watchable . my grade : D Eye Candy : Toy , and Aggie Valdez show tits ; Misty Mundae gives full frontal ; Danielle Riley shows EVERYthing ; and various extras show much skin as well
401054	7743887	57076	10.0	One Of The All-Time Bond Greats	Nowadays whenever a Bond film is trotted out on British television , the viewers ' usual response is ' oh god , not him again ! ' . It was very different in 1976 , the year ' From Russia With Love ' got its I . T . V . premiere . ' Dr . No ' debuted the year before to an audience of nearly twenty million . ' Bond ' on television in those days was an event akin to a Royal Wedding or the finale of ' Britain's Got Talent ' . Everyone watched . B . B . C . - 1 made no effort to complete - they ran John Huston's ' Moby Dick ' , starring Gregory Peck , for the umpteenth time . I had not seen the Connery Bonds before - my first taste of ' Bond ' on the big screen was ' Live & Let Die ' starring Roger Moore . ' Love ' begins with a nervous-looking Bond stalked through a garden at night , firing his Walther PPK at thin air . A blond man strangles him with a wire hidden in a wrist-watch . Lights snap on . Agents of S . P . E . C . T . R . E . ( the Special Executive for Counterintelligence , Terrorism , Revenge & Extortion ) appear . The killing has been carefully timed . The dead ' Bond ' is only a double . Psychopathic Red Grant ( Robert Shaw ) is specially selected for an important mission ; seething at the loss of their agent Dr . No , the organisation wants both to kill Bond and discredit the British Secret Service into the bargain . They use a beautiful young woman , Tatiana Romanova , by making it appear that she wishes to defect , bringing along a Russian cypher machine - the Lektor . She will only go if the agent sent to bring her back to London is James Bond . It is obviously a trap , but the chance of getting a Lektor is too good to pass up , so off Bond flies to Istanbul , taking with him a gadget-laden briefcase supplied by Q ( Desmond Llewelyn's first appearance in the role ) . This is a different Q to the stuffy , starchy character the world came to know and love . The film itself is quite different to its predecessor . Very Hitchockian , particularly the helicopter chase ( obviously inspired by the crop dusting plane scene in ' North By Northwest ' ) . Terence Young once again handles the directorial chores superbly , and gets first-rate support from editor Peter Hunt . As Bond , Connery is cool , elegant , sophisticated and slightly arrogant , you can see why even now his is still regarded as the definitive portrayal . The supporting cast are marvellous too , particularly Daniela Bianchi as ' Tatiana ' , Pedro Armendariz as ' Kerim Bey ' , Vladek Sheybal as ' Kronsteen ' , and Lotte Lenya as ' Rosa Klebb ' . S . P . E . C . T . R . E . boss ' Ernst Blofeld ' makes his debut , but is glimpsed rather than seen . The scene-stealer though is Robert Shaw as ' Red Grant ' . He looks as though he really could kill Bond . His fight with 007 aboard the Orient Express is still for my money the most impressively choreographed action sequence in the whole series . Having arranged Monty Norman's ' James Bond Theme ' for ' Dr . No ' , John Barry was promoted to composer , and turned in the first of several memorable scores . The title theme was by ' Oliver ! ' composer Lionel Bart , and sung by Matt Monro . Richard Maibaum's script is by and large faithful to Ian Fleming's book , with the addition of S . P . E . C . T . R . E . and a number of outdoor action scenes , including the speedboat finale . The structure is impressive ; the first part has the villains setting up the trap , the next sees Bond walking into it ( to obtain both the Lektor and the girl ) , and in the last he fights to stay alive as the jaws begin to close shut . When ' Love ' opened in 1963 , the world welcomed it with open arms , and Bond's future on the silver screen was assured . One year ago , ' Love ' secured the honour of becoming the first Eon Bond to be shown on the B . B . C . and how good it was to be able to watch one without all those annoying ad breaks , not to mention cuts . Alas I . T . V . continues to rape and pillage the 007 legacy ; most recently , the films were used as ' fillers ' on Saturday afternoons , a time usually reserved for children's movies and sports coverage . Bond deserves better .
583246	1219578	298130	7.0	scary , thoughtful and satisfying which is fine with me	These last years , apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen , American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture , especially the Japanese one . Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow " Kill Bill " ( ) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie ( but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot ) . In the derivative " the Last Samurai " ( 2003 ) , Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant " Lost in Translation " ( 2003 ) . Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture : to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper : " Ringu " ( 1998 ) . Against all odds , he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director . " Mousehunt " ( 1997 ) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but " the Mexican " ( 2001 ) was a lame movie . Some friends had told me : " don't watch " the Ring " , it's a hokey movie " . I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping . It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience . I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison . The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick . The main character , Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it . What do these outlandish and eerie images mean ? What lies beneath them ? At her own risk , she and her son watch the video . She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video . " The Ring " could well illustrate this famous premise : " to understand evil , we've got to go back to the sources . . . " . What distinguishes " the Ring " from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients . Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects . Still better , Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story . On an unhurried pace , Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel's investigation . His directing is also worth the price of admission . It is well-crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments . Besides , what is notable in " the Ring " is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer's nerves . This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension . Lighting and makeup shouldn't also be forgotten . The thrust of " the Ring " isn't only to entertain and to make shiver . It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image . One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera . So , she's also looking at the viewer . This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream , woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers ' fears . The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true . Moreover , these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols : the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness , the figure at the window ( a hint at " Psycho " ? , 1960 ) might symbolize parental severity . That said , Verbinski's genteel piece of work isn't exempted of drawbacks . Rachel's little boy is a cardboard character , a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in " the Sixth Sense " ( 1999 ) . When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel's companion , it's nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something , all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur . . . well , you get the picture . But they're minor quibble and don't overflow too much on the thrill of the vision . I repeat it : I haven't seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve , without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches , it can be gratifying . And in the case of " the Ring " , rightly so . . . A sequel " the Ring 2 " opened last year . Is it worthwhile ?
477283	463200	66580	10.0	Superb documentary	Oscar-winning documentary on the 3 day long concert back in 1969 . Despite more people showing up than was expected and running out of food , water and medical supplies and dealing with a torrential downpour everything went fine . There was no rioting , no violence . . . just people helping each other out . The film beautifully captures all this . It contains interviews with the kids attending the concert ( their views are absolutely incredible ) , people in the surrounding town , the police , media . . . all viewpoints are presented . Everything that comes through is tolerance , peace and love . The musical acts are varied - - you'll love some and hate others . For me the definite highlights were Joan Baez ; the Who ; Sha-Na-Na ; Joe Cocker ; Crosby Stills & Nash ; John Sebastian ; Country Joe McDonald ; Sly and the Family Stone and Jimi Hendrix . Also the sound is great and there is superb editing during the sequences with excellent use of multiple screens . I saw the directors cut with adds 40 minutes of music ( bringing the running time up to 3 hours and 40 minutes ) . They add Canned Heat , Jefferson Airplane , Janis Joplin and another number by Hendrix . Except for the Joplin footage none of it is really good or needed . The original 3 hour cut is fine . Warning - - there's lots of swearing , nudity , sex and drug taking . It didn't bother me , but it might bother others - - originally this got an X rating because of it ! A great one of a kind movie . Don't miss it !
519292	8239592	373900	8.0	Absorbingly sordid trash	1978 , Los Angeles . Lovely and charming psychiatrist Dr . Samantha Stone ( well played by the gorgeous Brittany Daniel ) interviews nervous and scared suspected serial killer Kenneth Bianchi ( a strong and compelling performance by Clifton Collins , Jr . ) in order to determine if he's sane or crazy . Director / co-writer Chris Farber relates this engrossing story in a deliciously flashy'n'trashy style which creates a considerable amount of raw energy and crackling intensity . Farber's unapologetically seamy and nasty rub-your-nose-in-the-gutter sensibility may not be subtle , but it does give the picture a lurid vitality that's both exciting and arresting in equal measure . Moreover , there's a vivid and credible evocation of the wild anything-goes hedonism and amorality of the 70's . For example , Samantha is the total opposite of a squeaky clean goody-goody two shoes heroine ; instead she's a completely uninhibited swinger who smokes pot and participates in crazy drug'n'sex orgies . Daniel and Collins , Jr . are both excellent in the leads , with Collins , Jr . in particular a stand-out with his frightening portrayal of raging psychosis and seething misogyny . The supporting cast is likewise solid and praiseworthy : Lake Bell as Samantha's brassy District Attorney best friend Jillian Dunne , Bret Roberts as Samantha's scuzzy dope dealer boyfriend Jack , Tom Wright as the hard-nosed Detective Bryant , and Mike Haggerty as Bryant's equally gruff partner Detective Smith . Tomas Arana makes a brief , but still memorably chilling appearance as the coarse and slimy Angelo Buono . Eliot Rockett's gaudy , dynamic cinematography keeps the camera constantly moving throughout while Ryan Beveridge's moody score further enhances the overall edgy tone . As a nice added bonus , the luscious Daniel bares her beautiful body a few times . A pleasingly tawdry wallow in the celluloid sewer .
524820	4445210	26481	7.0	Not Much Of A Story , But It Was Still Fun	" Beans , " one of Boston Beans ( according to him ) gets rudely rebuffed from entering " Warmer Brothers " studio . In fact , he gets thrown out twice , once at the entrance in his car , and later , bodily given the heave-ho out of the studio . There is no real story here , just Beans getting into the studio , accidentally getting in the way , accidentally pulling a switch and bringing the Frankenstein monster to life , and then dealing with him . The " story " has a very abrupt ending . Humorous moments included the dancing camera on tripod ; bartender playing music to cash register keys and the monster eating the camera , spitting it out and adjusting his jaw . Although there wasn't much to it , I enjoyed it . The scenes were fast-moving and you have to keep in mind this was made over 70 years ago . This was part of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3 DVD .
516598	1132073	95719	10.0	The Nest !	This movie here called The Nest is a decent horror film . The cast performs well and it includes Robert Lansing , Lisa Langlois , Franc Luz , Terri Treas , and Jack Collins . The special effects are good . There are some really gory effects in this picture and should be enough for the big horror fan . Someone who doesn't like horror may think this film is too much on several categories but this is a horror movie fan's and a roach lover's dream come true ! The music is good . There aren't many films like this one . In fact there are very few and I don't think they make em like this anymore . Back in the 1980s this was made and that great decade allowed films like this to be created . This is a very different movie and if you are a horror fan , insect movie lover , and / or a fan of any of the cast members I mentioned above then watch The Nest !
514737	317399	465624	7.0	A Nutshell Review : My Super Ex-Girlfriend	Look ! Up in the Sky ! It's a bird ! No , it's a plane ! No , it's G-Girl ! New York City's newest superhero , with powers and origins adopted from Metropolis ' Man of Steel . She can fly , has super-strength , can hear the frequency of a police radio , able to shoot beams from her eyes , looks like Uma Thurman . . . she's the ultimate hot babe any dude can ask for . Unless of course , given her powers , she's also a tad insecure and can turn out to be any dude's worst nightmare with her clingy , needy nature . If Superman's alter-ego Clark Kent is mild mannered , G-Girl's equivalent in Jenny Johnson is the bespectacled arty type with a touch of neuroticism . It's basically a romance between her and an unlikely , fairly ordinary bloke Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) , who picked her up during a train ride with the encouragement of good friend Vaughn Haige ( Rainn Wilson ) , and with a stroke of luck , managed to snag a date and more . It's a fun movie about relationships , or the desperate lack thereof , and given it's reversal of super-being gender , provides a different perspective altogether . While the comedy's fun at certain points , with its load of sexual innuendos and situations ( somehow it's almost always about sex ) , the movie felt like it went on autopilot , relying pretty much on its strong links to its adapted source material , right down to the parody of her weakness , You have that dastardly evil genius villain Professor Bedlam ( Eddie Izzard ) , and many scenes taking a mickey out of the Superman movies . It plays out similar to the earlier Ivan Reitman movies , like Ghostbusters and Evolution , kinda kinky , kind funny , formulaic and pretty much children friendly ( despite the sexy bits ) . I thought that the cast had a pretty fun time doing the movie , with supporting characters like Anna Farris providing additional eye candy as the love rival . The special effects by Digital Domain were pretty nifty too , and I liked those swirly-bits when G-GIrl takes flight . Don't bother too much about the uber-thin storyline , but just enjoy the ride right up until the quirky , amicable settling of outstanding issues . And if you really wanna try to look hard into it , it's a reminder to us guys that soon enough , women will rule the world , and we probably don't mind sitting back and enjoying that odd beer while they bring home the bacon . Stay tuned after the animated end credits for an easter egg scene involving Vaughn and his apparent secret beneath his cool-cat demeanour .
584072	1219578	69219	6.0	Philippe Labro's first effort . .	. . . and his best . All that he made afterward can easily be dismissed as rubbish . A journalist - he also wrote words for some songs - he dreamed of the American cinema because he spent some of his youth on the other side of the pond . Actually , we're closer to Agatha Christie's whodunit than to American film noir . It's not a problem . It's better to have a good imitation of a detective story à la " and then there were none " than a pale reflection of Wise or Hawks . One by one , people who did something nasty in the past are slain and detective Trintignant is here to solve the mystery , a mystery which entertains the audience till the very end . Outside Trintignant , the cast is very odd , including French crooner Sacha Distel , as an emcee of a stupid radio contest ( a wonderful spoof ) , Segal , who wrote " love story " , Chabrol's then-wife ( and ex-wife of Trintignant ) and best actress Stephane Audran , Italian not yet sex symbol Laura Antonelli , here cast against type , Jean-Pierre Marielle . . . Very entertaining .
443343	819382	19702	7.0	High muzzle velocity .	Sound was hardly used in film before Hitchcock began his playful experiments with it . In " Blackmail , " Annie Ondra has stabbed and killed a lustful neighbor in defense of her virtue . No one knows who committed the murder but the next morning it is the talk of Chelsea . Ondra is haunted by guilt . She sees mementos of the murder everywhere - - a policeman's outstretched hand , or a bread knife . In the back room of her father's small shop , she tries to slice a loaf of bread , but there is a goofy looking woman customer lounging in the doorway and chattering on about the killing . Ondra's hand trembles as she listens to the customer carrying on . Oh , it wouldn't be so bad if the victim were bopped over the head with a brick - - that's a British way . But a knife . How could anyone use a knife ? The annoying customer's voice degrades into a background mumble except for one recurring word . Mmmm , mumble , mumble , mumble , KNIFE , mumble , mumble KNIFE ! The last one is practically a scream and the bread knife seems to leap out of Ondra's hand . The director was to conduct a number of other experiments with sound later in his career , from Bernard Hermann's shrieking violins in " Psycho " to the electronic clutter of " The Birds . " The story itself is kind of interesting if not exactly gripping . Mainly we see Ondra and her detective boy friend from Scotland Yard trying to hide her involvement in the crime . However , it's discovered by a seedy character who begins to blackmail the two of them , at first simply be asking the boy friend to pay for a particularly expensive cigar . An unnerving scene , so small , yet so portentous . It turns out that the blackmailer , although he had nothing to do with the murder outside of seeing Ondra enter the dead man's flat , has a police record . Suspicion falls on him . The police pursue him to the dome of the British Museum . He crashes through the skylight and falls on the floor far below . I didn't find the ending very satisfying . Ondra goes to the police station to confess , which she should have done in the first place . Her boy friend meets her there before she can spill the beans . But until now , he knows only that Ondra was in the would-be rapist's room . Now she tells him that she murdered the libidinous scoundrel . The boy friend - - John Longden by name - - now sees things clearly . He clenches his fists and stares towards the camera , not for the first time . And then he and Ondra walk away together , hand in hand . Well - - what happens NEXT ? What did they do , run out of film ? Does she hang or go to jail , or is everything swept under the rug by the two of them who are in cahoots ? The code would have prevented Annie Ondra's getting away with murder , even if by middle-class standards it might have been justified . But the code doesn't seem to be at work here . The attempted rape is clearly depicted for what it is , though hidden behind a bustling curtain . And Ondra has either been too innocent or not nearly innocent enough , prancing around in her underwear in a strange man's apartment , teasing him when he sketches a nude woman on his canvas , cooing with delight over his attentions . Any conclusion is left hanging , and I didn't get the impression this was intentional ambiguity . Still , the story has an abundance of tension and the guilt that torments Annie Ondra must have appealed to Hitchcock , who was to continue using it as an important theme in his later movies . One wonders what he did as a child . Maybe it's the responsibility of the Jebs .

555202	1406078	316465	7.0	On the air	Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town ? The answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap , James Kennedy , understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene . Also , the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart . " Radio " , directed by Michael Tolllin , is a formula film inspired on a true story . Yet , the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast . Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man , who is called Radio because his passion for collecting them , involved in sports , a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life . Coming from a poor background , Radio , lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions . Radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot , at first , then , his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body . The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr . who make a great pair as the coach and Radio . Mr . Harris , one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence . He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past . Cuba Gooding Jr . is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man . The supporting cast is excellent . S . Ephata Merkerson , one of the best actresses of her generation , does interesting work as the mother of Radio . Alfre Woodard , another good actress plays the high school principle with style . Debra Winger , only has a few scenes in the film . " Radio " , while being sentimental , will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them . Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us .
563882	102816	277296	7.0	So he's . . . the bad guy ?	Okay , I'm confused . The Mummy Returns portrays the Scorpion King as some evil tyrant who wants to take over the world by smiting any and all civilizations in his way . But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie . In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons . So when , and why , did he become bad ? I'm afraid I'm not following this . The movie , however , is entertaining , if rather short and silly . Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can . It works and The Rock is very cool as said King ( or Mathayus ) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily-clad Cassandra . Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comic-relief and big , muscley guy . The film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies . This is evident with the fun and lively , but completely inappropriate , score by John Debney . I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC . But this movie is a cheeseburger , not a 17-course dinner . So why bother complaining . After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a re-make of a movie that was made in the 30's . But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy . Filmed in Panavision the DVD is in perfect 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with very loud and thrilling Dolby / DTS 5 . 1 sound . The extras are fluff , but that's to be expected .

The dialogue only sparkled ( dimly ) in some places . It was about an hour too long and left a bad taste in my mouth and an awful feeling in my stomach . Even the title sucks . Rum Punch would have been a much better title . I mean what did TARANTINO HIMSELF say about the name BROWN in Reservoir Dogs ?
564813	102816	34554	2.0	Not funny	This is surely the weakest Bugs Bunny cartoon I've ever seen . Beaky Buzzard simply is not funny and has no appeal at all . As a matter of fact he's down-right annoying . He's not a character I wish to see again in further Looney Tunes cartoons . This short has him preying after Bugs because Mama Buzzard wants him to go out and catch his first dinner . Bugs obviously doesn't take so well to this and doesn't make it easy for the bird . But where is the usual Bugs Bunny intelligence , outsmarting , battle of wits ? Not here I tell ya . Beaky Buzzard is not a formidable opponent for our fave rabbit and this cartoon is completely DOA . Avoid it .
558671	2626332	378194	9.0	AKA KILL BILL VOL 2 . . . One of the few worthy sequels	This chapter of the " Bride's " story picks up precisely where it left us , at the end of Kill Bill , Vol . 1 , and seamlessly carries us forward through the second half of Tarantino's dark and twisted saga . This chapter was not nearly as sanguineous as the first , but was more treacherously deranged ( if you can believe it ) . The execution of this screen play and the filming styles are inspired and simply breathtaking . As the stakes mount in the Bride's game of cat and mouse , the players find they must stop at nothing , in order to survive her rampage of unrelenting revenge . Tarantino took out all the stops and directed one of the most disturbing and dastardly sinister enterprises I've seen . I can't think of a single film which compares to the atmosphere and story , the depth of these characters , and the overall enjoyability of the work that is Kill Bill , Vol . 2 . I wholeheartedly recommend this run to anyone who has a love of revenge movies , action flicks , and splatter fans ( though splatter fans may prefer Kill Bill , Vol . 1 , now that I think about it ) . It rates the exact same rating as the first at an from . . . the Fiend : .

Is he really the man he claims to be ? There's a trial but he wins his case thanks to a mysterious person ( Berry ) who turns to be a blackmailer . Adapted from a Kafka novel ( not THE Kafka ) , this is an interesting work : Vanel portrays with conviction this bewildered man , in search of his identity . Best scene shows an old lady , chasing him out of her flat , saying he's not her son , then , when the door is closed , bursting into tears . Kurt Bernardt had begun his career in Germany , as contemporary of Lang and Murnau , but these works are almost impossible to see ( he directed Dietrich ) . Then , after a stint in France , he headed for America where he directed minor movies , most of them forgotten , including the remake of perennial French tear-jerker " le voile bleu " ( as " the blue veil " ) . Most interesting is the influence of the movie on later works : - In 1983 , Daniel Vigne directed " Le retour de Martin Guerre " . During the Middle Ages , a man comes back to his home . but is he really the one he claims to be ? Well you get the picture : a remake in disguise . - in 1992 , " Sommersby " was a remake of " Martin Guerre " ( actually the re-remake of " Carrefour " ) .

I wonder if Scott will ever get a fair trial after the showing of this picture . The jurors in this case have a very hard job in trying to be fair and just !
493864	342623	32256	7.0	Nelson and Jeannette sing their hearts out	Jeannette MacDonald is an English woman who falls in love with her teacher ( Nelson Eddy ) and runs away with him to Vienna in " Bitter Sweet , " a 1940 musical based on a play by Noel Coward . Sarah ( MacDonald ) gets away from her family and a man she doesn't love to be with Carl ( Eddy ) who sings and composes . They have a hard time making ends meet but eventually start making money performing in a club . When a top producer is brought to the club to hear Carl's music , the future looks rosy . It's just an illusion . The film was given a top-notch production in color , and Jeannette not only looks lovely but wears the most glorious gowns ! I have always preferred Jeanette's acting to Nelson's and Nelson's singing to Jeanette's . Both of them sound wonderful singing Noel Coward's music , including the beautiful " I'll See You Again . " For some reason , both MacDonald and Eddy had uncredited " vocal stand-ins " - I would assume these people did not sing for them but perhaps rehearsed with the musicians , because Nelson and Jeanette sounded like themselves . MacDonald's voice had a fluttery quality and her tone tended to straighten at the top , but the middle voice and lower tones sounded beautiful . And you can't beat her presence . Eddy , of course , was a magnificent singer , totally suited to the operatic stage . He just never seemed that comfortable in front of the camera . Reminiscent of " Maytime , " this is a treat for Eddy-MacDonald fans .
460499	2467618	403031	7.0	While not a great film , I'd watch it just for Tunde Adebimpe	A while back , I watched a strange but fascinating independent film called JUMP TOMORROW . What I liked most about this film was the strange character played so well by Tunde Adebimpe . His delivery and manner were so nerdy but sweet that you couldn't help but like him - - - even though he was a total dork . So when I found that THE FIRST THREE LIVES OF STUART HORNSLEY was included on a disk of short films from The Film Movement Series , I was excited . Now as far as the film goes , it's not an easy one to get into . The first half or so is very slow and difficult like - - even though , once again , I liked Tunde Adebimpe in the lead role . Still , despite the slowness of the film , stick with it - - the payoff is there and it's worth seeing .
401202	7743887	197158	6.0	Big Breadwinner Hogg	' Hogg's Back ' was an I . T . V . children's comedy series which starred the late Derek Royle ( best remembered these days for playing ' Mr . Leeman ' in ' The Kipper & The Corpse ' episode of Fawlty Towers ' ) as Dr . Hogg , an incompetent country quack brought out of retirement to administer the needs of a quiet country village . Stammering , twitching and fumbling like a terminal piles sufferer , Hogg caused chaos wherever he went . You definitely wouldn't want him at your bedside with a thermometer . Royle was an acrobat in his younger days , and the ability served him in good stead here . The scripts were by the late Michael Pertwee , who wrote classic comedy movies such as ' Laughter In Paradise ' . ' Hogg's Back ' was far from his best work , but I suspect if released on D . V . D . now would outshine many modern comedies for sheer belly laughs . Jacki Piper , who played Hogg's secretary Pearl , left mid-way through Season 1 , to be replaced by Wendy Richard . In Season 2 , Pat Coombs joined the cast as Hogg's housekeeper .
485514	1416505	60472	9.0	Simply the best racing movie ever made .	After 40 years , this still is a very exciting movie to watch , especially obviously for race fans and F1 fans in particular . As weird as it might sound , " Grand Prix " is a real period movie . There is an immense difference between ' 66 Grand Prix racing and present day Formula 1 , in terms of rules , cars and mostly safety regulations . In that regard it makes " Grand Prix " an already outdated and old fashioned looking movie . By todays standards the races and cars in this movie look ancient . In a way it all speaks way more to the imagination , perhaps because of the reason that the sport looked ( and was ) so much more dangerous back then . It makes the movie also very exciting and the races in the movie thrilling . No way a movie like this could be made this present day . The story most definitely isn't the strongest aspect of the movie and it features some typical stereotypical and dramatic elements you could expect from a sport movie but thank goodness that the movie really lays its emphasis on the racing elements of the movie . The movie its story visits some of the best racing tracks in the world , Monte Carlo , Zandvoort , Spa-Francorchamps and Monza . Spa in the movie is still for most part a road circuit and the Monza track has a couple of large and incredibly dangerous banking on it , like a NASCAR track . For a racing fan it already is an huge experience to see this circuits in their old glory . The tracks looked better and were more challenging back then but also way more dangerous than now . None of the tracks still exist in this form present day . Also one of the powerful things about this movie is that everything is real . No miniature or computer generated cars and drivers , this is the real stuff ! Racing movie really don't get more realistic than this , with for most of the time also the real actors racing in the real cars . Again ; No way a movie like this could be made this present day . The movie uses some interesting experimental techniques , some more successful than others by the way , such as in-cockpit cameras and multiple split-screens . It makes the movie a totally unique viewing experience . The crashes in the movie are totally over-the-top but spectacular nonetheless . Seeing cars crashing in the Monte Carlo harbor and flying straight into the water is a spectacular sight . But not only the crashes are spectacular , also the races in general are brought spectacular to the screen . The way of filming puts us right into the cars and directly in the middle of the action . It makes us part of the action during the races , which should get your adrenaline flowing . The acting is the greatest , with the exception of Eva Marie Saint , who was really great . Nevertheless the characters remain good and interesting enough , although they are extremely stereotypical . It also seemed that all of the non-English speaking actors in the movie for halve of the time had no idea what they were saying . They deliver some of the lines in a totally wrong way , like they had no idea what their sentences meant . This goes mostly for Yves Montand but also for Antonio Sabato . But luckily , like I said before , the movie lays its emphasis in the racing elements of the movie , which makes the acting and story comes sort of secondary . For race fans ( and Formala 1 fans in particular ) an absolute must-see ! Race movies don't get any better and more realistic than this one .
551463	989035	51745	7.0	Cozy romp with some surprising emotional resonance	At first glance , " Houseboat " looks like the worst type of sitcom : stern father gets saddled with his estranged children , later hiring a governess who is really a runaway from high society . Saccharin-prone viewers might bail early , but give it time . Cary Grant plays the dad with an amusing mixture of concern , consternation and suspicion ; he enjoys a good time , but he goads his kids into being more than what he sees , and when his son pushes back it seems an exceptionally realistic reaction . As for Sophia Loren , basking in her movie-star close-ups , she takes a cartoonish character ( which is written like a cynical refugee from " Roman Holiday " ) and gives the lady a big heart . Her bonding with the children ( and with Grant ) is a treat , and while I wasn't quite convinced it would all work out happily , I was genuinely entertained . A surprising jewel . from

443130	819382	74085	6.0	Too Little , Too Late .	Five members of Black September take a dozen or so Israeli athletes hostage at the Munich Olympics in 1972 , killing two others . Led by Franco Nero , they demand the release of more than two hundred Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails . Israel refuses to agree and the German authorities ( William Holden as Schreiber , Chief of the Munich Police ; Shirley Knight as head of Women's Olympic Security ; Richard Basehart as Willie Brandt ) are stuck with the nasty task of trying to resolve the problem themselves . They botch the job . There is a shootout at the airport and all the hostages are killed , along with some of the terrorists . The surviving killers are released from jail later , when other terrorists hijack an airliner and hold seventeen passengers hostage . This is a linear narrative . It illustrates the sorts of glitches that authorities run into when faced with an unanticipated problem . Unanticipated ? Hell , inconceivable . No one could any more imagine hostages being taken at the 1972 Olympics than the simultaneous hijacking of four American airliners by terrorists intent to flying them into buildings . The first German to talk to the terrorists , played by Shirley Knight , walked up to the captors and angrily demanded to know , " What IS this rubbish ? " ( The encounter is shown a little differently in the film . ) Until the dimensions of the situation were clarified - - the dead bodies , the impossible demands - - it was treated as a breach of etiquette . No one in a position of power had any idea of the correct course . Nothing like this had ever happened before . Happily the film shows all the points of view , without slipping into pathos . It doesn't have to be sentimentalized . A mature audience must already be aware of the emotions involved . Yet the documentary approach robs the film of some of its dramatic impact . It isn't helped by the acting . The performances are , with a few exceptions , below the expectable par . Richard Basehart , whose work I've admired elsewhere , has the elan of an animatronic figure in Disneyland . Still it's good to see the events laid out evenly and schematically . Anthony Quayle is on the spot as an Israeli security adviser . And several Moslems , including an Egyptian and a representative of the Arab League , are brought in to try talking the terrorists out of their plan . The simpler , and more devious approach is to treat the Israelis as humans , demonize the murderers , and show the rest of the world as indifferent , with the Germans perhaps even complicit . This is more or less what " One Day in Munich " does . Spielberg's " Munich " is slanted in the same direction , although it's a mature film . The accidental killing of an innocent Arab waiter in Lillihammer , Norway , is omitted , and so are the death and wounding of several German police officers at the climactic shootout . In a way , Spielberg's movie is an apologia for Mossad , as " The Godfather " was an apologia for the Mafia . ( I'm comparing the structure of the movies , not the organizations . ) The annoying little things are left out . And one can't help wondering about that " no negotiating for hostages " axiom either . Why not ? If they give in , every Israeli everywhere will become a target . Well , a rat in a Skinner box will certainly repeat activities for which he's rewarded , and he'll avoid those for which he's punished . Some of the rules obviously apply to humans as well . ( The slot machines in Vegas put the player on a fractional reenforcement schedule designed to maximize the response - - feeding the machine coins - - while minimizing the payoff . ) But in a complex condundrum like this ? The Arabs take hostages at Munich and lose . Later , they take hostages on an airliner and win . Punishment in one case , reward in the other . Did the difference in outcome lead to differences in later behavior ? Nobody knows . A few focus groups would help , if you can get terrorists to agree to participate in them . The script presents some interesting ideas . Shirley Knight and Franco Nero have gotten to know one another a bit towards the end . By this time it's clear that Israel will not negotiate and Nero's plan is shot . Knight tells him , reasonably and not ungently , that the entire world is watching to see what he will do next . Wouldn't it be a good idea , she insinuates , if Nero showed the world the more favorable profile of his movement and released the remaining hostages and put an end to the killing ? " What ? " , Nero bristles , " and have people think I am a coward ? " And Knight replies , " So these people must die for your vanity ? " It's a provocative question - - how many innocent people must die to preserve one man's self image ? If the movie doesn't exactly reach out and grab you by the lapels and shake you back and forth , I'm still glad it was made .
409944	2567136	111342	9.0	Dorks Rift	This is just one more example of why French cinema is the best in the world . No real story , no suspense , no sex , no violence BUT ! also no cgi , no slasher movie # 24 , no Hollywood Formula - The Sequel . In short just two of the finest actors on the planet running with a situation in which virtually out of the blue the wife tells the husband she is in love with another man . It's never that quite out of the blue of course and one of the strengths of this movie is the writing on the wall which is in turn projected onto the screen ; the smallest hairline fractures in what , on the surface , is a perfect marriage complete with child . Juliette Binoche is a fine actress , no question , but it is virtually impossible to picture anyone other than Isabelle Huppert in the role of Anne and the same applies to Daniel Auteuil as Pierre , each of them fully inhabits the role in which they have been cast and although there is outstanding support from Jerome Deschamps and Karin Viard it is really superfluous . One of the finest films of the 90s , not just from France but from anywhere but it helps if you go to movies to check out the Human Condition rather than to spray popcorn at each other .
498734	1355507	681823	3.0	Predictable soap opera .	Quincy M . E . : Quincy's Wedding : Part II ( it says ' Part II ' on screen & not ' Part 2 ' not that it matters much ) starts as Quincy's ( Jack Klugman ) & his fiancé Emily's ( Anita Gillette ) relationship lays in tatters after the wedding is called off . Meanwhile Edna ( Jeanette Nolan ) goes back to the rest home in order to flush out her husband's killer at her own risk . . . Episode 18 from season 8 this two part story was written & directed by Jeri Taylor & predictably revolves around Quincy getting married to Emily . To be honest I don't like the way Quincy has gone during season eight in particular & Quincy's Wedding feels more like some horrible soap opera with a highly predictable murder mystery sub plot that is so contrived & downright silly it's hard to keep a straight face when the killer is revealed . So Quincy finally gets married but why wasn't Brill or Eddie or Diane or even Pete the guard invited to the wedding ? They have been with Quincy since the series started seven & a half seasons ago so why were they left out ? I'm not being funny but I'd have been pretty upset at not being invited & I thought Quincy was better than that . During the wedding Quincy is only ever referred to by simply Quincy & his first name is never revealed . Quincy also says his vows to Emily which are quite poetic & sweet but then the scene is absolutely ruined by Emily who then bursts out in song & sings her vows , it's a truly teeth clenching moment of embarrassment that I don't want to even think about anymore . Speaking of Emily the actress who plays her Anita Gillette is awful , just look at the scene at the start of this episode when she overacts horribly on the phone to her mum when she's supposedly upset & crying . Quincy's Wedding : Part II is another terrible soap opera style Quincy episode where the makers are trying to change so many of the things which made me like the series so much until now that I just can't like it & as such I didn't like it .

V . , an experience from which he never recovered professionally . Harry Enfield , alas , didn't learn from this , quitting the B . B . C . to make this horrible Sky One production , which , apparently , even he didn't bother to watch . Enfield is an amazingly talented comedian , but alas was let down by the atrocious material , shoddy production values and mediocre supporting cast . Paul Whitehouse and Kathy Burke were sadly missed . Some of Harry's new characters - such as James Bond's idiot brother , and the sex-mad fisherman - look and sound like rejects from ' The Fast Show ' . One sketch consists almost entirely of profanity . Unlike Hancock , Harry is thankfully still with us , and one hopes he gets his career back on track one day . ' Brand Spanking New Show ' was a criminal waste of his talent , an insult to Harry's many fans , for which the people behind it deserve a good spanking .
423917	2248099	373450	6.0	The truth is , this film isn't everything it wanted to be	I was hoping this film would live up to the high standard set by the first two Atom Egoyan films I'd seen , The Sweet Hereafter and Felicia's Journey ; but unfortunately , Where the Truth Lies is a film with bags of style , but almost nothing in terms of substance and despite a focus on characters ; the film feels very flat and pointless by the time the conclusion to the sophomoric mystery plot is finally revealed . The film focuses on the partnership between Lanny and Vince ; a pair of comedians that were a huge success back in the fifties ( kind of like a smarter , American version of Ant and Dec ) . Their partnership ended fifteen years ago , and sexy female journalist Karen O'Connor decides to research the life of one of the partners , and get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding the death of a young girl whose body was found in the bathtub of the partners ' hotel room on the night after a big TV show that the couple were doing . This film isn't a complete loss , and that is thanks to the way in which it is filmed . Atom Egoyan seems to have been trying to capture a classic film noir style , and he succeeds somewhat ; although the dark picture has been discarded in favour of beautiful bright colours . Egoyan relishes in capturing the beauty of his lead actress Alison Lohman , mostly through the movement of her lavish head of red hair . She is joined by the insanely talented Kevin Bacon , who isn't forced to give his best performance ; but adequately gets through the film . Colin Firth rounds off the central cast , and does a good job of capturing the sleazy nature of his character . The old-fashioned style of the film is interesting at first , but this isn't kept up until the end , and I was getting more than a little tired of it before the film ended . The ending is something of a non-event , and the film feels like it should have a far more sophisticated conclusion considering the nature and style of the production . Where the Truth Lies has a number of memorable sequences ; the ( underdone ) lesbian sequence chief among them , but there isn't enough positive elements to ensure that Where the Truth Lies will be remembered as anything other than an interesting failure .
382610	449021	95119	6.0	You have to fall down in order to get back up .	A very watchable impression of Frank DeFord's novel . The bigger they come the harder they fall . This story follows most of the life of Louisiana football legend Gavin Grey ( Dennis Quaid ) . The " Grey Ghost " lived big with a life sustained by adoring football fans for his exploits on and off the football field . He married his number one fan and cheerleader Babs ( Jessica Lange ) who shared his glory , heartaches and tragedies . His brother Donnie ( Timothy Hutton ) and best friend Lawrence ( John Goodman ) tried to keep Grey grounded and at the same time kept him high on admiration . Carl Lumbly plays Narvel Blue who's competitive nature like Grey's built a strong friendship . As years passed , so did the glory wane . . . the football hero just had trouble realizing it . Like Elvis Presley once said " The image is one thing and the man is another . It's often hard for the man to live up to the image . " I've always liked Dennis Quaid and thought his cockiness made the role of a self-centered football player come easy . Impressing is the fact he did some of his own stunts and separated a collar bone taking a solid hit on the field . He looked like a natural . For the stunning Lange , she seemed flawless as the cheerleader with only one thing on her mind . . . her idol the " Grey Ghost " . Marriage matured her , but at fault lived sharing the glory surrounding a Louisiana favorite son . Goodman deserves more credit than he usually gets . How can you not like his bosom buddy character ? Retired pro , semi-pro and top college athletes provided the realism on the playing field . You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy EVERYBODY'S ALL-American .

Schizophrenic comedy-drama from director Jonathan Demme is excessively barbed , edgy , and uncertain in tone ( set-pieces that should be hilarious aren't - - such as the sequence with all the Mafia wives in the supermarket - - and just when a moment is about to take off , a violent undercurrent spoils the fun ) . Nearly every character is written and played for over-the-top laughs , but these people are not amusing on looks alone , and Demme doesn't allow the comedic momentum to build ( he keeps the secondary characters flailing about , while scenes are pared down into frantic bits of business ; Demme has already made up his mind how we're supposed to feel for this assembly long before we even know their agendas ) . After hobbling through a laborious opening , the movie does eventually pick up steam . Stockwell and torturous wife Mercedes Ruehl overdo it , but Pfeiffer is fresh and appealing - - she does more for the movie than it does for her . from

Suffice to say if you enjoy romantic films you'll like this - it's sweet-natured , amiable and enjoyable . The performances are a highlight , and as a trivia note , it was Pacino's second pairing with Pfeiffer since the film " Scarface " almost a decade prior . .
482899	1293485	120815	10.0	One of the best war movies ever made	I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold . This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg . The movie is incredable . The beginning was horrifying . I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch . When I studied WW2 in high school , I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady . But Speilberg did . I felt like I was there with the soldiers . I felt their fear , pride , and love for their country . I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war . And whenever I go to visit Washington D . C . , I have more American pride then ever . I am more than proud to give this movie a
460277	2467618	35160	7.0	So very , very different from the Hollywood film	This movie is a ripoff of James Cain's novel , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE . Apparently , the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story - - perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties ! Despite this , the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie . In some ways it's a lot better and in other ways , it is definitely not . The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . In fact , the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking . The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair ( particularly on the back and shoulders ) and his lady love is , to put it frankly , unattractive . They are a very , very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version . And the ill-fated husband is really , really obese and loves to walk around shirtless - - and his counterpart in the American film , Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking ( and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads , actually ) . And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film - - since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed " dish " like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway - - I am 100 % sure she would have had dozens of better offers ! Whereas , the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable . Part of the Italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway , they never actually get around to sex ! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . In addition to the casual sexuality of the film , it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life - - with lots of sweaty people , a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath . The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film . And what you get due to brevity isn't all good . The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film - - with grainier footage , relatively poor orchestration and sets . It sure ain't a pretty film , but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic . But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot . Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over . And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film - - and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats ( the best part of the American film ) . So which is the better film ? Well , a lot of this probably depends on you . As for me , the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic ( though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles ) - - but it packed a great ending . And the Italian film was much , much more realistic - - until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . So neither film is exactly great , but I'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better . It's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .
459969	2467618	120855	6.0	okay . . . . just okay	I think a major problem with me watching this film is that the character Tarzan has been done so many times that I frankly am pretty tired of him . He's been in 1001 films and at this point , what is there to add to the story that hasn't already been said ? Generally , this movie seems to say " nothing " . The addition of " cool " gorilla playmates wasn't enough to invigorate the series and as a result of such familiarity of the content , the film is just a very well-made time-passer . Sure , it's very good technically and my kids enjoyed it , but the film has very little lasting appeal . I've been to The Magic Kingdom dozens of times and apart from just after the film debuted , there is almost no reference to it - - nothing . And I think this says a lot about this adequate film .
551435	989035	60908	6.0	Satirical whimsy plays like romantic Kubrick ( with a touch of Fellini )	Villagers in a small town North of France in 1918 believe their homes will be blown up by the Germans and quickly evacuate ; Scottish soldier Alan Bates is " volunteered " to infiltrate , and inadvertently lets loose the patients in a lunatic asylum who got left behind . French-Italian co-production is a handsome little fairy tale with wartime satire and child-like whimsy , and director Philippe de Broca wastes no time setting the scene and getting right down to business . His approach is romantically silly and simple , but he's never simple-minded or pretentious . The filmmaker also uses Bates to his best advantage , keeping him running crazily like a patient himself , and he's careful not to overdose on Genevieve Bujold's youthful beauty ( she's around just when she's needed ) . Funny and sweet , the movie was something of a slow-rising cult hit , and was back in theaters after some ten years had passed . from

Another sequence of events in the post-sanitarium life of Norman Bates , in which he makes the acquaintance of troubled former nun Maureen ( Diana Scarwid ) and sleazy young drifter Duane ( Jeff Fahey ) and is also actively investigated by nosy reporter Tracy ( Roberta Maxwell ) . The most routine " Psycho " movie yet , an average and tolerable horror thriller but nothing more . It gets most of its mileage from the savvy performance of Anthony Perkins , who must have truly understood his tormented character more than ever by this point . Some interesting touches and a not totally unsuccessful attempt at creating suspense ( for the finale ) don't hurt . Of course , there is the obligatory dose of nudity and gory death ( not a lot of it , but some ) to please the 1980's horror audience , making this movie less of a Hitchcock homage than the first sequel and more of a typical modern scare movie . Supporting cast was okay ( a few cast members from " Psycho II " do a reprise of their characters ; I like Hugh Gillin best as Sheriff Hunt ) . " Psycho III " , marking Perkins ' directorial debut , is mainly , I think , for " Psycho " completists . Followed by two TV movies : ' Bates Motel ' ( which I have heard is truly horrible ) in 1987 and ' Psycho IV : The Beginning ' in

But Anthony Hopkins , I think , did a splendid job . I managed to buy this one by mistake , through clumsiness , and it just isn't the same . The actors don't seem to speak slowly enough , I guess , and Iago seemed miscast , no Derek Jacobi . But , heck , the sound on this DVD was so lousy that no one could overcome that obstacle . And this is an inexpensive production , looking very much like a stage . I'm not convinced that Shakespeare is so hot that even a misplaced production like this is worth much attention . It's not like the Lord's Prayer or anything , suitable for all occasions . As much as I hate to say it , I'm afraid that Olivier and his elaborate extravaganzas have got practically a lock on the material . It's not just the production values either - - the blaring trumpets , the real live horses , the period costumes . It's Olivier's performances . He speaks slowly enough in , say , " Hamlet " to understand his every word , though we may not know its exact referent in the real world . And when he speaks quickly , as in much of " Richard III " , he still manages to articulate each juncture . His pauses are precisely timed . And , by God , anybody who can turn the half-mythical but ever-filthy Richard into a clown has got my vote . Hopkins ' version of Othello was splendid . As someone said , " he has the kindest EYES . " Now THAT was the tragedy of the Moor . This version is just a tragedy .

As Young was reclusive , he is easily mistaken for the deceased servant . Then , Young meets lovely Lillian Gish ( as Alice Challice ) , who had been corresponding with his valet ; and , a romance blossoms . Unable to convince anyone of his true identity , Young happily marries Ms . Gish . Complications peak when the new " Mr . and Mrs . Henry Leek " are visited by the first Leek family . Dull version of the Arnold Bennett play " The Great Adventure " ( 1913 ) , which was most memorably filmed as " Holy Matrimony " ( 1943 ) . " His Double Life " is livened , however , by a rare 1930s film appearance by Gish . Though the presentation of the story is not at all convincing , Gish's performance is sincere . Her " tea party " with the original Leek family is the film's highlight . His Double Life ( 1933 ) Arthur Hopkins - Roland Young , Lillian Gish , Montagu Love

385986	391152	50188	8.0	Ambitious , uneven , but overall excellent Bollywood melodrama	Nargis stars as a suffering woman , Radha , experiencing tragedy after tragedy , surviving it all . The first half of the film doesn't promise anything overly special . A poor community falls under the weight of a moneylender , Sukhilala . When Radha marries , her mother-in-law mortgages her farm to pay for the wedding and Radha's jewlery . Since the mother-in-law has no education whatsoever , Sukhilala , probably the only educated man in the village , is able to take advantage of her . When she challenges Sukhilala's claim , she can't do much to disprove their deal . This part of the story is pretty cliché , rather predictable and very questionable . Sukhilala is a fairly standard villain , very cartoonish and simplistic . The audience is programmed to hiss at his every appearance . The conflict is compelling , but I was hoping for something more complex . It is nice , I suppose , to see the system challenged , but the fact that the system is challenged does not necessarily mean that the film challenges the system in an insightful manner . In reality , the film's solutions to the problems are all melodramatics . Luckily , something else is brewing in the film at this point . Radha has two sons , Ramu and Birju . The story starts to focus in on Birju , who is very obnoxious . His mother loves him dearly , spoils him , and he becomes simply evil . I should say at this point that the little kid who plays him as a child , Master Sajid , is very , very annoying , not to mention a terrible little actor . As an adult , Birju is a devil . Sukhilala still runs the place , and now Birju is big enough to do something about it . Thankfully , Birju is not made a hero . Well , perhaps an anti-hero , but at least we're spared him becoming an Indian Robin Hood as I expected . Complexities begin to develop in the way Sukhilala is depicted , and , while he's still the villain , the audience is no longer programmed to despise him on site . Radha has to both protect her son and stand up for what is right . The climax is so extremely impressive that I was almost convinced that the film was great . Yet the film is not what I would call great as a whole . There were dozens of scenes that I loved , but , as the film goes on for three hours , there was plenty to dislike , as well . The fat and gristle detract . Did I mention there are great songs ? Great indeed ! I love Hindi music myself . The cinematography is also often exceptional . .
417972	663392	36307	1.0	Horrible B Film	Always enjoy the Classic Horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments . This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world . Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film . Mantan Moreland , ( Jeff ) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention . I hate to criticize a film made in 1943 , but this is really a big disappointment . If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula throughout many films during the 1940's , you just might like to watch John doing his best .
504247	2911571	486640	6.0	Offensive , disgusting , stupid , and actually , not bad for Boll	To be honest , before this I'd seen only ONE film from Uwe Boll . . . House of the Dead . And that was enough to put me off his films forever . It was bad in ways that words can barely describe . But then , I had heard a lot about this particular film , " Postal " , so I decided to give it a chance . And really , despite the fact that it's offensive , disgusting , and stupid , it's really pretty good . I've seen far worse comedies from Troma , and this actually would fit in fairly well with their catalog , except it's a bit slicker and well made . The story is that Zack Ward is an unhappily married denizen of a trailer park , who has a disgustingly fat wife and no job . He ends up hooking up with his uncle Dave Foley , who is the leader of an " end of the world " cult . Now Foley is in trouble with the IRS for back taxes , over a million , and of course he hasn't got the money . So Ward & Foley hatch a scheme to steal a shipment of Krotchy dolls ( little cuddly uh , penis-like things ) to make a killing , but to do so , they must hijack the shipment at a Nazi-themed amusement part , run by Uwe Boll himself . There's also Osama Bin Laden and his gang on the loose , and they also want the dolls , but for other reasons . And lots of mayhem follows . Let's not forget Vern Troyer ( Mini-me , from the Austin Power's films ) . He's got something to do with the Krotchy dolls , apparently a kid's TV show and I'm not sure if he appears costumed as one of these things or not , it's not clear . Vern has a very foul mouth & a suitcase full of sex toys , among other things . Last we see of this little guy , he's being put into a chamber filled with horny monkeys . Oops . Is this all well connected and well done ? Well , not really . It's a bit difficult to follow & it's got quite a few plot holes . But is it funny ? For the most part , yes , and there's even quite a few clever lines that surprised me , too . And the ending was great . If you like your comedies in very poor taste , then this is for you . There are no " sacred cows " that escape a good dragging through the mud . A very un-PC film , and if you like that sort of stuff ( I do ) , then you have to see it at least once . .
573113	4248714	74256	7.0	Bugsy Malone	I had heard the title many times , and then I found out that the twice Oscar winning female star of The Silence of the Lambs was in it , and I thought why not . Set in the 1930's , this story is loosely based on the gangster exploits ( e . g . Al Capone ) during the Prohibition era , but all characters are played by children , no adults at all , unless you count the singing voice of Paul Williams . Basically the film centres on the ongoing gang battle between ( named because of his physique ) Fat Sam ( John Cassisi ) and ( named because of his classy fashion sense ) Dandy Dan ( Martin Lev ) , and both are fighting to have the best weapons to take out their threats , i . e . the custard pies , and the essential " splurge gun " . Bugsy Malone ( Scott Baio ) is around during this conflict , he starts as a bystander , a penniless boxing promoter down on his luck , but he gets a job for Fat Sam as a driver , and he agrees to help with whatever he wants . Bugsy also meets his love interest , Blousey Brown ( Florrie Dugger ) , who is ambitious to be a film star in Hollywood . Bugsy makes the money she needs to take her their , but he is mugged and money stolen . He was rescued after this mugging by Leroy Smith ( Paul Murphy ) , who has boxing talent , so Bugsy trains him as a boxer , and Leroy becomes his unofficial sidekick . Oh , Blousey also gets jealous when she sees Bugsy flirting with Fat Sam's girlfriend and lead singer , Tallulah ( twice BAFTA winning " newcomer " , 14-year-old Jodie Foster ) . Also starring Albin ' Humpty ' Jenkins as Fizzy , Davidson Knight as Cagey Joe , Sheridan Earl Russell as Knuckles , Paul Chirelstein as Smolsky / Boxer ; Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ' Dexter Fletcher as Baby Face , Vivienne McKone as Velma , Helen Corran as Bangles , Andrew Paul as O'Dreary , and an uncredited Phil Daniels as Waiter who spills spaghetti . The acting is pretty good for youngsters , the songs are quite fun , the pie and cream fights are always a treat , and young Foster proves to be worthy to-be movie star . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Paul Williams , it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design / Art Direction , Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track , and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music , Best Costume Design , Best Direction for Alan Parker ( Fame ) and Best Film , Parker was nominated the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy , Best Original Score and Best Original Song for Williams ' " Bugsy Malone " . Jodie Foster was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , the film was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Musicals , and it was number 39 on The 100 Greatest Family Films . Very good !
435889	9938570	68833	7.0	Last House on the Left	Two teenage gals , newly friends , are on their way to a rock concert when they desire to score some reefer and wind up in the throes of terror when the supplier , Junior ( Marc Sheffler ) is actually the junkie son of an recently escaped psycho from prison , Krug ( David Hess ) who are holing up in a shoddy apartment with another sicko Weasel ( Fred J Lincoln ) and their nutso girlfriend Sadie ( Jeramie Rain ) . After having their way with Phyllis ( Lucy Grantham ) , the street gal , as her virginal friend Mari ( Sandra Cassel ) looks on in horror , the psychopathic four toss them in their car trunk the next day , hitting the road for Canada when the vehicle runs out of gas . The kicker is that the car runs out of gas just nearby Mari's home , yet neither girl can cry out . Into the wilderness the girls are forced into committing humiliating acts or else suffer the consequences . Yet , even after being run through the ringer ( . . Phyllis forced by Krug to pee in her pants , the two having to commit lesbian acts , both girls stripping , etc ) , their lives are still jeopardy as Phyllis attempts to escape as Mari , having been cut by Weasel earlier , suffers mental anguish hoping to coerce Junior into letting her go as the others run after the other . When the escapes fail , the four will finish them off and clean up , finding themselves at the home of Mari's parents . When Mari's father and mother ( Richard Towers & Cynthia Carr ) find that these cretins , who they have allowed rooms to sleep for the night , have murdered their baby girl , revenge is on the menu . Getting past the brouhaha of how unpleasant and disturbing it is , I'll skip to the moments that effected me . The way Weasel moves his knife up and down his nose just itching to stick it in someone . How quietly intense and homicidal Hess is as Krug . . bulking and tough , his menacing features are even more fearsome because of his brooding nature . Jearmie Rain , out of the four killers , is the most over-the-top and demented , loudly applauding her men's cruel and violent behavior , relishing their graphic acts on these two girls . Marc Sheffler's ugly features work well with such a pathetic character , who never had a chance in life considering who his father is . He's as much a victim as Mari and Phyllis . I actually thought Lincoln , as the no-nonsense killer Weasel ( . . always seen with his knife as if it were an extension of his pecker , taking good care of it ) , is about as good as Krug . He just doesn't care about anything , except the knife and getting to use it and having no sense of morality or conscience makes him almost as much a monster as Krug . I think Craven achieves what he sets out for with these sick bastards . . if you are caught alone with these people , vulnerable , you have little chance of surviving because they have no boundaries holding them , no reason or guilt . I can see the film's influence on modern horror particularly in the photography as the camera often shoots characters from odd angles , sometimes capturing one or more actors on screen close-up or just a few feet away . The wilderness murders I found especially effective , although a lot of the violence is hinted instead of fully elaborated on . I think the film's in-your-face camera directing into the faces of the psychos works quite well as they inflict harm to the girls , with their faces showing the trauma occurring to them both physically and emotionally . When someone tosses the word " raw " out there , I think it's quite appropriate for Craven's film here . There's no cinematic polish in store for a viewer watching this for the first time . I think the film is simple in story , with the shocking violence doing the most work in leaving the lasting impression . Almost like a true crime story of what a group of serial killers do to victims in the wrong place at the wrong time with fate dealing them a bad hand , LHotL works from a very terrifying level , and I felt Craven's camera-work and editing of the wilderness murders displays just that . It felt like someone , hanging around with the brood , was filming their deranged activities . The revenge angle , I think Craven has mentioned this before , displays the theme that almost anyone , if pushed over the edge by some sort of horrifying ordeal , could kill . What could release you from a moral obligation to not harm human life . . the murder of your only child perhaps ? While perhaps this doesn't leave the same impression as the murders of the girls before , there's still something powerful about what parents will do after the loss of their loved one .
548188	1111192	85937	1.0	Oh my god . . . he does the voice of Frosty .	Yes , it has been awhile since I saw this one , but one thing still sticks out . The fact that the guy who does the voice of Frosty the Snowman plays a deranged perv who kills women and eats them . For the most part a very poorly done movie . You would think in a movie that is basically about cannibalism that there would be lots of gore . Not in this one . This one is almost totally a comedy , though it won't make you laugh all that much let me tell ya . A guy whose wife can't cook finally goes berserk and kills her in a rage . He has no recollection of this rage and finds her dead body in the microwave where he decides to heat her up . Let me say this is one big microwave cause her entire body fits in it . Then he grabs something to eat , I think the next day . He accidentally grabs her arm I think and starts chomping away . He finally realizes what he is eating , but it apparently tastes so good he doesn't mind . The ending to this one is pretty out there , but then this entire movie is out there . You keep seeing Frosty going " Happy Birthday " !
435712	9938570	417072	9.0	R-Point	Those who liked " Deathwatch " may wish to check out this ( even better ) Korean ghost tale from director Su-chang Kong about a group of South Korean troops in Vietnam searching for a missing group they heard a distress signal from . Once they get up to a location called R-Point where these old Temple Ruins are located ( signifying in a different language that anyone with blood on their hands would be cursed ; it's stated that this location goes untouched by either the North or South Vietnamese ) weird things start to occur . They meet people , actually talking to them in conversations , only later finding their dead corpses . They set-up a base-camp at an eerie dilapidated castle and try their damnedest to find the soldiers . . but even finding their own way out of R-Point seems impossible . Soon various soldiers loose their grip on sanity . . we soon learn that ghosts and guns can only lead to a heap of trouble . There's possibly even some possession involved as well . I thought it was good and creepy . The setting amongst the grass-infested ruins and castle just adds to the eerie atmosphere of the ghosts often appearing from the dark .
365092	4888011	175142	10.0	And they just keep on coming , don't they ?	The rating of course only applies to people who would desire to watch such a movie ( for anyone else , it's a zero ) . A spoof of " Scream " , " I Know What You Did Last Summer " , and other such movies , " Scary Movie " is another in the gag-a-minute genre associated with the Marx Brothers , Mel Brooks , the " Airplane ! " crowd , and so on . Some scenes were kinda gross ( they can't go without scatological humor , can they ? ) , but overall harmless . The end was a real surprise . I never saw " Scary Movie 2 " ( I assumed that it was the same ) , but I did see " Scary Movie 3 " . . . and it was pretty much the same . And there's a " Scary Movie 4 " coming out soon ( we can probably assume that it's the same ) .
518500	8239592	75005	9.0	Worthy of its classic status	Ambitious American ambassador Robert Thorn ( an outstanding and dignified performance by the inestimable Gregory Peck ) begins to suspect that something is amiss with his adopted son Damien ( well played by gifted child thespian Harvey Stephens ) following a troubling series of odd and fatal " accidents . " Thorn and cynical photographer Keith Jennings ( the always excellent David Warner ) embark on an investigation which takes them all over Europe in order to uncover the truth about Damien's possibly satanic origins . Director Robert Donner and screenwriter David Seltzer give the fantastic supernatural premise a semblance of plausibility by firmly grounding said story in a believable everyday world . Moreover , Donner maintains a steady pace throughout , keeps the tone resolutely creepy and serious ( there's a welcome absence of any dumb and obtrusive humor ) , and stages a few elaborate murder set pieces with breathtaking go-for-it verve ( an impalement on a huge spike and a stunning decapitation by a large runaway pane of glass are especially effective while a cheery young nanny happily hanging herself at a birthday party proves to be genuinely shocking and disturbing ) . Better still , the special effects are used in an admirably judicious manner and the picture overall primarily relies on developing and sustaining a potently unsettling gloom-doom mood to get under the viewer's skin . The tension gradually builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch and culminates in a truly harrowing last third . The uniformly sterling acting by a first-rate cast qualifies as another major asset : Peck and Lee Remick as Torn's sweet , yet frail wife Katherine bring a tremendous amount of class to the film , Billie Whitelaw gives a positively chilling portrayal of sinister governess Ms . Baylock , Patrick Troughton excels as intense priest Father Brennan , and Leo McKern contributes a neat cameo as occult expert Carl Bugenhagen . Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's glossy cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's supremely shivery'n'spooky Oscar-winning score . A superior mainstream horror hit .
398941	1391795	105466	4.0	New To Our Fall Schedule : " No Survivors . "	TV veteran John Ritter plays Roy Knable , a pathetic couch potato who is easily duped into buying an extravagant new system by the mysterious Mr . Spike ( Jeffrey Jones ) . The catch is that Roy and wife Helen ( Pam Dawber ) are sucked into this system and made to participate in the shows . They have 24 hours to get back to the " real " world . VERY mild , rather disappointing comedy is a one-joke comedy , and that one joke is dragged out too long . There are some chuckles to be had , sure , but overall the movie is below average . It might have worked better as a series of skits on " Saturday Night Live " or something like that . The one segment that admittedly stands out is the animated segment where Roy and Helen are turned into cartoon mice . Cast is OK but they've better utilized , and given better performances , in other films . Jones is the one actor who seems to be having the most fun . It is recommended for those who would like to see Ritter in a hip-hop wardrobe and dancing to Salt-n-Pepa's " Start Me Up . " At the very least , it is likable and harmless . Though I still give it .
442394	819382	49513	7.0	Above Average Adaptation	Captain Ahab ( Gregory Peck ) commands the whaler Pequod in 1842 and convinces the crew that they should pursue and kill the giant white whale , Moby Dick , instead of doing their jobs . Ahab has vengeance on his mind , the whale having divested him of a leg on a previous voyage . But it goes beyond that . The whale stands for Something with a capital S , but it's not clear exactly what . " He haunts me , " says Ahab to his first mate , Starbuck ( Leo Genn ) . " He heaps me . Yet he is but a mask . ' Tis the thing behind the mask I chiefly hate . " Whatever the thing behind the mask is , it's not a sled named Rosebud . The story is a impasto of meanings , some personal , some theological , and some positively mystical . Ahab's quest is at bottom blasphemous . A " dumb brute " has taken his leg , more or less in self defense , and Ahab refuses to accept his fate . A couple of observations . At the turn of the last century , Max Weber , a German sociologist , wrote " The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , " in which he argued that it was Protestantism , with its idea of a " calling " , that facilitated the development of industrialism . A truly religious man worked hard to make a lot of money or , as Starbuck puts it , the whalers of the time provided the world with oil , which was good for society and was therefor a service to God . Melville was also right in making Starbuck a Quaker because Quakers valued humility before arrogance . ( Massachussetts has given us more presidents than any other state ; Pennsylvania has given us one . ) That's from E . Digby Baltzell , not Weber . I mention Weber's insight though because it's kind of important to our understanding of how shocking Ahab's decision was , to put aside what was a service to God in order to satisfy his individual desire . Nowadays we accept self satisfaction as worthwhile in itself . In 1842 , it was like giving God the finger . Undoubtedly , the whale oil lobby of the time would have endorsed this religious sentiment . The whale oil interests fought like the devil to keep the street lamps from being lighted by kerosene or gas . There are obvious Biblical parallels too - - Ishmael and Elijah - - but it's not clear exactly what they mean . Elijah in the story is a raggedy man who prophecizes the crew's fate before they sail , so he is a prophet , as in the Bible . The performances are pretty good . Gregory Peck is surprisingly effective as the half-mad captain , considering that lunacy is not his strong point . The rest of the crew are up to par . Orson Welles as Father Mapple gives a terrifically hammy sermon from his ivory pulpit . The use of music is pretty well done , though the score itself is unexceptional . At the first sighting of Moby Dick , there is no sound at all but the hushed rushing of sea water from the beast's field and the whoosh of water from his spout . In a modern film we'd expect the scene to be overscored . The editing is a little clumsy . A shot of Pip , the ship's boy ( who plays a much larger part in the novel ) , seems to come from another movie . And the special effects are not what they would be today , but we have to give them a pass because everyone in 1956 was working within technological limits , as we are today . It would have been nice , though , to have a Moby Dick as realistic as the shark in " Jaws . " Maybe Hollywood will still come around to the idea that it is time to remake the movie , so many remakes of so many earlier films having appeared in the last two decades that one wonders if the industry has run out of original ideas entirely . The next version may be a sequel : " Moby Dick , Part Two : Ishmael's Revenge . " On the whole I didn't find the real scenes of harpooning and killing whales ( shot off the Irish coast ) to be very satisfying . Whales are mammals , the biggest on earth , and harmless to us . I was walking along the shore of Chichigoff Island in Alaska , miles from any human , and was startled by a long , loud , echoing crack of expelled breath . Two huge whales pushed to the surface , placid and unperturbed by my presence , although the experience had me shivering with awe . Maybe that's part of what Melville was trying to get at . Isn't it a bit blasphemous to tear apart the planet we live on , instead of treating as a God-given trust ? Must we exterminate the elephant to provide the world with billiard balls ? I don't know . I'm just wondering if Melville may have had , among his other concerns , some sense of living in harmony with Nature , with a capital N . It's hard to pin down exactly " what inscrutable thing " Melville and Ahab were dealing with , except that it was more than just a big cetacean .
570975	4248714	126745	5.0	The Famous Five	When I was younger , this used to be on CITV ( Children's Intergallactic Television ) quite a bit . When it was on it was quite an interesting show of kids against adults . Basically four kids and one dog ( making five ) solve mysteries even though their parents tell them not to meddle in other people's business . That's the thing , they never listen and the parents never let them . But they always managed to solve the crime in the end , catch the bad guy / girl . I did like some of the story lines , but after a while it started to get a bit boring so I only watched it when I felt like it . The only annoying thing about it was I couldn't tell if George was a boy or a girl . Worth watching !
429840	1173088	115819	5.0	Has some good parts , but is ultimately sophomoric and not as consistent as Trey and Matt's later work	" Cannibal ! The Musical " is inspired by the true story of Alferd Packer ( although his real name was allegedly " Alfred " and " Alferd " came about because he didn't know how to spell his own name correctly ) . Packer was one of only two men - along with Albert Fish - to ever be convicted of cannibalism in America . ( Apparently serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer had enough going against him already that he wasn't tried for cannibalism on top of mass murder ) . Packer led a group of five men into Colorado in search of gold . They got lost and were stranded in desolate conditions , and eventually Packer killed his men and ate them . ( Although according to Wikipedia recent evidence indicates he never killed them , and in 1981 he was apparently acquitted of crimes long after his death . I guess they figured eating people who are already dead in order to survive doesn't qualify as full-out cannibalism . I'm not really sure about the specifics on how that works . ) Trey Parker and Matt Stone made this movie before " South Park . " I believe it was actually filmed in 1994 and first screened at the Alferd Packer College ( yes , there's a college named after him ) which is presumably located in Colorado . It's become a cult film over the years and the title was changed to " Cannibal : The Musical " after Troma producers convinced Trey that not enough people outside of the state were aware of who Alferd Packer actually was . ( I certainly wasn't - I thought it was a fictional character before looking up the film on Wikipedia . ) First things first - I have so far been largely unimpressed by Trey and Matt's live-action ventures . I've become a huge " South Park " fan within the past year or so , but I bought " Orgazmo " on DVD and thought it was a very juvenile and average comedy , and although I have not seen " BASEketball " yet , even Trey and Matt have acknowledged that it is not a good film , so I don't feel like I'm entirely missing out . " Cannibal " is a huge cult film and I had heard a lot of good things about it from various people on the Internet , in particular one Troma video fan . Well , this is my first Troma video ( if it qualifies as one ) and maybe that's part of the reason I couldn't get into it . Parts of it are very funny , but for the most part it really isn't very humorous at all . It actually develops something of a story and isn't as loud or obvious as some of Parker's other material . " South Park " is very satirical and witty but it's much more obvious than the comedy here , which is tamer and not quite as edgy . Some of the songs are quite funny but a number of them are inferior versions of songs that would appear in the " South Park " movie and " Team America : World Police . " Songs from that film like " The End of an Act " ( the one that bashes Ben Affleck and Michael Bay ) are much cleverer and musically catchy than anything found here . The cast is generally weak and Trey is visibly awkward throughout - presumably since it was his first real movie . It's very low-budget ( filmed for $125 , 000 - compared to the eventual $1 million they received per episode of " That's My Bush ! " in 2001 ) , and part of the reason the film isn't as engrossing at times is due to its budget : it looks like a student movie made by some friends who made up a lot of gags as they went along . . . and for the most part that's probably a rather accurate summary . I know the film has a cult following and an impressive rating on this site , but I think if you're not a die-hard Trey Parker fan or a follower of the Troma film series , it'll leave you a bit underwhelmed , especially if you're familiar with the boys ' recent work on " South Park " and " Team America . " It has its strong points but they are far and few between , and for the most part it's a very amateurish production that isn't up to par with their later stuff . An interesting note of curiosity for fans of " South Park , " but I couldn't really warm up to it .
460606	2467618	19688	10.0	hilarious early Laurel and Hardy short	This is the granddaddy of all Laurel and Hardy fight with the neighbor shorts . A small disagreement escalates to a near-world war and destruction and mayhem result . This formula worked great here and was reprised in such Laurel and Hardy films as TIT FOR TAT , TWO TARS and THE BULLFIGHTERS . All these fights are excellent , but I have to give a higher score to this film because it was the first and most outrageous . Laurel and Hardy are door-to-door Christmas tree salesmen ! Naturally , their business is terrible ( since it is Stan and Ollie ) and some of their prospective customers , namely James Finlayson , are irritated by their bothering them . Well , this mild irritation quickly escalates to breaking the boys car and the boys destroying the man's home . All this is very funny and well-paced and I especially liked the ending - - it might just catch you by surprise . This silent short is about as good as you can find from this duo . By the way , this film appears in an abbreviated form at the end of Robert Youngson's compilation film WHEN COMEDY WAS KING ( 1960 ) .

This is the best thing to watch if you've seen a typical by-the-numbers Bond movie , one of the old ones , for example , and thought it was ridiculous , or at the very least something other than great . The plot is directly spoofing the old Bond movies , with an evil villain trying to take over the world . The acting is pretty good , for a spoof movie ; the characters are mostly caricatures and stereotypes , to further parody the Bond movies , but they add to the humor of the film . Mike Myers is great in this movie , pretty much anyone who likes him will probably enjoy him in this . I loved how it was spoofing the Bond movies , sometimes even mentioning the ludicrousness of the characters actions in details . If you're into 60's stereotypes , crude sexual humor and some great Bond-spoof action , you'll most likely enjoy this . I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies , and who's seen at least one Bond movie and thought it was a bit ridiculous . It's filled to the brink with crude sexual innuendo and Bond-spoofing .
513443	3223254	435505	5.0	Two Short Films on One DV	Joseph Graham both wrote and directed the first of the two short films on this DVD . He has some interesting ideas both textually and visually and manages to condense into 47 minutes a film that packs a wallop . ' VANILLA ' is anything but vanilla , if the term refers to the dichotomies between vanilla and kinky in the usual sense . A young lad Jeff ( Ryan A . Allen ) is a highschool photographer who happens upon the kneeling suicide victim body of a beefy serial killer in the Bay Area . Questioned by the police and his father , he becomes obsessed with the string of murders linked to sexual encounters with young men , and his curiosity contributes to an art project as well as his own drive to experience how the murders took place . Just how far his curiosity leads him is the fairly dramatic conclusion to this short film . The acting is pretty ' basic ' cum weak , and the acting out of the trysts is heavy , but Graham does use his story as a romance with the camera : the film is appropriately shot in both black and white and color with the uses of each more important than they first appear . ' A LITTLE COMFORT ' ( ' Just un pea de recon fort . . . ' ) is a brief 36 minute French film by director Armand Lamellose that employs better actors and better cinematography , and actually a better story . Arnaud ( Arthur Moncla ) is a young teenager coping with his attraction to the popular hunk Guillaume ( Remi Bresson ) who has a steady girlfriend . Arnaud imitates his idol trying cigarettes , alcohol and sex , finds a girlfriend but when both girls leave their beaus , Guillaume ( whose mother is dying and who has no family ) seeks refuge with Arnaud , whose mother is more than happy to have Arnaud's ' best friend ' stay with them rather than in a foster home . At last , in the comfort zone , away from the outside world , Arnaud and Guillaume bond , fall in love , and actually fit into the society that they feared would ostracize them . OR is this little tale merely the acting out of a dream for the tender little Arnaud . . . . it is up to the audience to decide . Films such as these , though each feel like works in progress , at least serve the intelligence of the film audience well . It has not been very long since such films would have never made it to the shelves of Amazon . com or the video stores . The success of ' Brokeback Mountain ' has opened a lot of windows , and for that we should be grateful . Now let's see the polished films of similar content that languish in the darker interstices .

554675	1406078	446784	8.0	My architect	There is an awkward moment in Sydney Pollack's documentary " Sketches of Frank Gehry " , when the subject of the film confesses about his name change from Goldberg to Gehry . Nothing is made out of it , but perhaps that defines a key to understand the man whose monumental work is examined by his distinguished friend , the director , Sydney Pollack . This is an intimate portrait of the man whose grandiose vision separates him from other luminaries of that field . Frank Gehry is shown working in different projects . It's curious how this man doesn't even know how to use the computer in order to create his intricate designs . It helps he is now a celebrity and wealthy , as he can afford assistants that will execute his thoughts in that new medium he has yet to master . The documentary gives us an idea of the evolution of Mr . Gehry as an innovator and the way he arrived at his present position . It surprising to realize that one of the greatest influences for him was Alvar Aalto , the great architect from Finland . One can see how he can relate to this man , more so than to others that were at the top of his profession during his formative years . We get to hear from a lot of people and his peers . Milton Wexler , his personal analysts confesses how he has worked with Gehry for so many years . Philip Johnson also gives his assessment about the man . Ed Ruscha , the artist , talks about other aspects of Mr . Gehry's life and he even gives credit to the architect's wife , Berta in being a great influence in his life , yet , no one sees her ; only a picture is shown of her . On the other hand , Julian Schnabel , a pretentious artist himself , and dilettante movie director , is interviewed wearing a white bath robe as he pompously describes Gehry to the camera . We feel he is putting us on all the time , that he couldn't care less . He is an admirer of the spaces Gehry creates because they go well together with his art , and the way it's shown . Michael Ovitz , another shady figure , shows up to tell us how he compares Gehry's approach as a form of cubism . Well , who knew the movie mogul was an expert in this matter too ! One of the most obvious omissions in the film is not interviewing Dennis Hopper in the home that Gehry designed for him in Venice , California . Some of the best examples of Gehry's creations appear in the film . The magnificent Guggenheim museum in Bilbao , Spain is presented in all its splendor . The same goes for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles . The other works are also shown , although , maybe because of the length of the documentary didn't allow to show more . At the end , when all is said and done , we see a man that like all artists is never satisfied by his own work .
442482	819382	457433	4.0	Routine Mystery .	Halle Berry is a reporter whose best friend is murdered . She pursues the case over the objections of her editor , who finally fires her . ( If she were a cop , this would be the scene in which she hands over her gun and badge . ) With the help of a friend at the paper , Giovanni Ribisi , she goes undercover and is hired by the prime suspect , Bruce Willis , a nasty executive at the firm where Berry's friend last worked , a guy who exudes menace and embodies a kind of serpentine lechery . It's a pretty tough slog for the viewer . The writers have done what they could but not much of interest happens , despite some trumped-up suspense plug-ins . Red herrings abound . Everybody turns out to have secrets of one sort or another and they are uncovered , one by one , except for those of the murderer . Halle Berry looks delicious , though she is no longer the cherub of yesteryear . That's not necessarily a disadvantage . The part calls for a fully grown and determined woman , not a cutie pie . Her acting is seasoned and pedestrian . Giovanni Ribisi is a good nerd but occupies so much screen time that we KNOW he's more than just a helping hand . Bruce Willis is toggled into his minimalist mode , which renders him more ominous but less human than in his usual action movies . I prefer him dashing along steel girders with a pistol in hand . The ending calls for a suspension of disbelief uncommon outside of frank delusions . I don't know why this is so dull . Maybe - - at least in part - - because no one has yet found a way to make participation in internet chat exciting .
505099	2911571	25465	5.0	very weird for 1934 but is it GOOD ?	This is a very strange movie , which , for me , is never a reason to not watch something , but this is stranger than most . Now , what's interesting that I didn't know about this is that writing credits go to one Edgar Allen Poe ? That must be why someone was getting walled up in the basement with a black cat . Anyway , this provides the viewer with textbook descriptions of types of insanity , which I guess are supposed to mirror what this ex-vaudeville guy , who just killed his mad-scientist boss and is currently masquerading as him , is doing , but it's pretty hard to tell . I wasn't too keen on the guy that keeps cats to sell their skins , or when a kitty's eyeball got popped out ( won't tell you what the good doctor DID with that though ) . Also wasn't too keen on the movie in general , really , I didn't find it to be much more than a curiosity and and I'm glad to say I didn't pay much for it . It is interesting for the fact that it shows that people have always been pretty twisted and yet not all people that have that distinction get to make films , and this being from the early 1930's , well , that's even more unusual . If you're interested in this , well , it is worth seeing once , just to say you did , but will you want to see it again , ever ? Suppose that'll be up to you . .
427320	3079504	252028	5.0	Funny , but ugly Christmas comedy	I will admit that much of this film is funny . There genuine laughs in this film of a man renting a family for Christmas , but there is such a mean nasty edge to much of it that I wanted to take a bath after seeing it . I have no idea why this well made film is so ugly but it it is . The opening montage of Christmas scenes sets the tone with the joyous Christmas Season standbys counterpointed with shots of greed , anger and suicidal thoughts . Feel good its not . Ben Affleck's is a horrible person and gets no sympathy even as he tries to be good and be touchy feelly , he's still a horse's ass . And yet I laughed , and it bothered me . Its terrible to say that for probably the first time in my life I felt bad laughing at a comedy . I can't recommend this , but it is funny . because it is funny .
420265	2542703	76095	8.0	Marsha Mason Does Helen Trent	Poor Marsha Marson . All of her relationships end in failure . The guy simply walks out . She has a precocious daughter , devilishly played by Quinn Cummings . The latter received a supporting actress nomination and faded from the movie scene real fast . Where are you Quinn darling ? Forced to share an apartment with a stranger , Mason may finally be on the right track . Richard Dreyfuss is that man and in a surprise Oscar winning performance ( Richard Burton was also up for Equus that year ) , he is perfect in the role as the charmer . By movie's end Dreyfuss has to go off to somewhere but unlike the other men in her life , will return . How do we know he is coming back ? Just see this delightful film and find out .
516850	1132073	258463	10.0	The Bourne Identity is a cool action movie !	The Bourne Identity is superb movie with great action and suspense ! Matt Damon is really a action hero in this film and in My opinion he could be a new action star . Franka Potente was very good and she is a promising actress if she is the good roles . Chris Cooper was very good . Brian Cox was very good and he looked different than he did in earlier films . Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good but the role he was given didn't allow him to do much but he is becoming one of My favorite actors . TBI is a very good film with some great action scenes that I never saw before ! If you like Matt Damon and spy films then go rent The Bourne Identity !
449938	2093818	120032	7.0	Pretty entertaining , if you're into " dumb " humor	This is another movie that takes the " dumb blond " stereotype and builds on it , just like , for example , Legally Blond ( e ) . The difference is that this film actually accomplishes it pretty well , and comes up with far more great humor , something that is probably mostly due to the R-rating ( Legally Blond has a different rating , a PG-13 , I believe ) . That doesn't mean that the film is packed with nudity or profanity , though . It does have its share of F-words , and the two main characters ( among others ) do show a little skin , but nothing serious . Most teens should be able to see this as well , and laugh at it . About the " laugh at it " , though , I will say that the film requires you to be able to laugh at fairly simple humor . It's not going to make anyone form philosophical ideas about it , nor is it going to impress you in any way , it only tries to entertain , and it succeeds , depending on , of course , whether or not you can laugh at dumb humor . It mostly consists of stereotypes ( main stereotype being the " dumb blond " one ) , but as long as you can accept that , you should be able to find it fairly amusing . I definitely laughed out loud at a few occasions , and was chuckling at many more . The plot is pretty good , it's about Romy and Michele ( as you probably guessed from the title ) , who , 10 years after high school haven't really gotten anywhere with their lives , and are told about a high school reunion . Fearing they may not impress their former schoolmates , they try to improve their lives . Hilarity ensues . The film has a pretty good , slow , unhurried pace throughout , very much like another teen comedy , American Pie . It doesn't hurry from one scene to the next , but it doesn't bore you either . The acting is pretty good , especially by the two leads , Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow . The supporting cast is also pretty good , especially Janeane Garofalo and Alan Cumming . I very much enjoyed Garofalo's sarcastic character , and her acting was great . The main characters also have great on-screen chemistry , I think . The characters were sufficiently well-written and credible , for a bunch of stereotypes . The soundtrack for this film was also pretty good . The films climax , that takes place at the actual reunion , is packed with pretty much every single reunion-cliche that you can think of , but still manages to entertain . All in all , a good comedy if you can enjoy the fairly simple-minded comedy of it . I recommend it to fans of " dumb " humor comedies , like Dumb and Dumber , and various other Jim Carrey comedies . Also , fans of dumb-blond jokes might also finds this amusing .
483054	1293485	75066	7.0	Actually , I think I liked this one better than the first two	The Pink Panther Strikes Again is the completion to the trilogy of the Pink Panther . Once again the detective is up to his clumsy ways of trying to save the world away from a man who has a machine that will make very important things disappear , maybe even a city or country ! My favorite scene was definitely when the detective dresses up as a dentist and comes to the villain's toothache pains . The laughing gas gets to both of them and together they just have a good time pulling out teeth that don't need to be pulled out . This is a pretty entertaining movie and I'm now kind of interested in seeing the remake . Hopefully it's a good one .
576285	1399158	78350	4.0	THE SWARM { Extended Version } ( Irwin Allen , 1978 )	This one is often often considered , along with WHEN TIME RAN OUT . . . ( 1980 ) , as Irwin Allen's nadir - not to mention one of the all-time worst films ! Michael Caine himself said it's the worst film he's ever been in ( contradicting his apparent enthusiasm shown in the accompanying promo ) - although he must have clearly forgotten THE ISLAND ( 1980 ) . . . Given the impeccable credentials , it seems that I keep giving it a chance - since this here was already my third viewing ( albeit the first via the extended version ) . It was also one of several ' attacking insects / small animals ' movies in the seventies - FROGS ( 1972 ) , PHASE IV ( 1974 ) , SQUIRM ( 1976 ) , KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS ( 1977 ) , EMPIRE OF THE ANTS ( 1977 ) , etc . ; other semi-notable bee movies are THE DEADLY BEES ( 1966 ) and THE SAVAGE BEES ( 1976 ; made for TV ) . They certainly spared no expenses where the cast was concerned : Michael Caine hams it up as a constantly fuming entomologist ; ditto for Richard Widmark's general ( who , at least , has the sense to not take it seriously ) ; Richard Chamberlain has a similar role to the one he played in THE TOWERING INFERNO ( 1974 ) ; Jose ' Ferrer turns up for a thankless one-minute cameo , whereas Cameron Mitchell appears unbilled . While it was nice to see all those Hollywood old-timers , the three-way romance between Fred MacMurray , Olivia DeHavilland and Ben Johnson was embarrassingly corny ! Incredibly , some 40 minutes were salvaged from the cutting-room floor to make up this inflated Extended Version - but the film seriously outstays its welcome in the second half , as it lumbers its way toward a ' philosophical ' conclusion . Apparently , several incidents in the film are ' inspired ' by THE KILLER SHREWS ( 1959 ) - but also THEM ! ( 1954 ) , especially the huge bug every victim kept seeing ( which is shown so often that it eventually becomes risible rather than scary ) . Even in spite of its great length , there are still a couple of blatant plot holes : Caine , Katharine Ross and Patty Duke Astin get locked inside a freezer during an attack on the town by the killer bees but we never learn how they manage to get out ; likewise , we're not told how the boy ( in whom Caine and Ross take a special interest all through the picture ) got ' sick ' again , a ' relapse ' he actually doesn't survive ! Ultimately , it's not the unmitigated disaster most people say it is - but the dialogue is so preposterous as to be unintentionally funny ( my favorite being Henry Fonda telling Caine that the raunchiest book he ever read was one the latter had written about the mating habits of the Queen Bee ! ) and the theme itself simply too far-fetched ( despite all the earnest sermonizing and the film's ecological stance ) ! INSIDE ' THE SWARM ' ( Andrew J . Kuehn , 1978 ; ) , included on the DVD , is a fluffy TV featurette made during production of THE SWARM : it ' s no great shakes and is mainly of interest for showing Irwin Allen at work during the 1970s ' " Disaster Movie " heyday . . . when the all-star cast are not trying to convince us that the film's earnest warning - that a catastrophic bee attack upon the whole of humanity is imminent - should not be taken lightly and we are therefore instructed to take every precautionary measure necessary ( the first being , I assume , to go watch the film at your nearest local theater ) !
544751	562732	117477	9.0	An excellent period film .	Ridicule deals with the consequences of a monarch or ruler running his empire according to his own personal interests , rather than concern for the greater good of the people . There were also a couple of underlying themes , such as the distribution of social classes overall and the ignorance of the upper classes , as well as the human suffering that comes as a result of arrogance , ego , and social status . A romantic conflict was a significant part of the story , dealing with the pain and guilt that someone may feel from seducing one person for manipulative purposes and actually being in love with a different person . The story is of a man named Ponceludon de Malavoy who needs to drain a mosquito and disease infested swamp , but he needs King Louis XVI's help to do it . He travels to Versailles , but finds that he needs to have the sharpest of all wits in order for the king to recognize his problem at all . He finds himself in a society driven almost exclusively by the measure of each person's wit ( or ' hew-mah , ' as they heard it was called in English ) , and the seriousness of Ponceludon's plight was second to this point , if it is noticed at all . It was more important to King Louis XVI to be entertained than it was to drain a swamp that was causing sickness and death even among children . One scene in particular was very effective in demonstrating the ignorance of the upper class . There was a boy named Paul who was a deaf-mute , and seen as a ' half-wit ' by the upper class people . Obviously , in this society this is the last thing that anyone wants to be . He is exiled from the kingdom , sent to live with other ? half-wits , ' only to return later with several other deaf-mutes after having learned to communicate using sign language . They are introduced to the upper class members , who are skeptical about the worth of the half-wits ' lives . When they see that these kids are able to communicate , they are noticeably impressed . They even give them a standing applaud when one of them manages to make a ' play on signs . ' They see that these kids are not only intelligent enough to communicate , but can even be witty using sign language , and this completely changes their view . They had always seen people like Paul as less important , simply because they are not able to speak or hear , which is clearly a symptom of classical ignorance . Ridicule is a period film , and it was very effective in illustrating the differences between elements of society today and of the society of 1793 . Obviously , honesty is very highly valued today . A recent survey showed that honesty is the third thing that women truly desire in a relationship ( preceded by affection at No . 1 and conversation at No . 2 ) . The same survey showed sex to be Number one on men's importance list , and this completes one of the sharpest contrasts seen in Ridicule . Ponceludon de Malavoy , the man seeking to have his swamp drained , is engaging in a sexual relationship with Marquis de Bellegarde , an attractive older woman of much higher social status ( ! ! ) . When he informs her of his lack of emotional feelings for her , she responds in a way that , in my opinion , is exactly the opposite of the way a woman today would respond , by literally telling him to lie to her . She tells him , ' Learn to hide your insincerity so that I can yield without dishonor . ' Aside from the fact that this shows that she would rather be bedded than loved , at least by Ponceludon , it also enhances the drama caused by his love for someone else , and his obvious feelings of guilt about sleeping with another woman . Ponceludon does not love her , but knows that she is capable of improving his chances of getting help from the king . Ponceludon , despite having sexual relations with Marquis de Bellegarde , the older upper class woman , is in love with a simpler , poorer woman named Mathilde . She develops very strong feelings for him as well , but she is engaged to a very old , very rich man . She is determined to remain engaged to him , even though he is currently married to another woman , so that he may finance her scuba diving interests . The fact that Ponceludon and Mathilde are both engaged in strikingly similar manipulative relationships makes their love for each other even more effective . There were dancing scenes later in the film where everyone wears masks and huge elaborate wigs , which demonstrated a dire need to be accepted . The fact that all of the wigs and masks worn in this scene were strikingly similar suggested that these people desired to be as much like everyone else as possible , and that individuality is discouraged . The men wore white powder on their faces , blush on their cheeks , and even distinct amounts of lipstick . Aside from being another way of illustrating conformity , it also poses a huge difference between then and now . In today's society , men who wear that much make-up are most often the ones who are actually trying NOT to fit in with the general population . One other thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that the exact words or topics spoken in the film are far less important than the way that they are said . Body language as well as things like costuming and make-up are far more important than the exact subjects that were spoken of . This was most effectively communicated to the audience by the fact that there were a few scenes where the French conversation was not subtitled . This forced the audience , particularly the English speaking audience , to focus more on the way the characters were speaking to each other rather than what exactly they were saying . This is very unusual , but is also noteworthy because it successfully furthers the meaning delivered by the film .
468414	1532177	86058	5.0	Good Cast . Not A Good Film	What a good cast . Burt Lancaster , Dennis Hopper , John Hurt who is probably Britain's greatest living actor - why hasn't he been knighted ? and Rutger Hauer before he became known as Rutger " straight to video " Hauer , but the cast never seem to be able to rise above this silly twisty turney cold war thriller . The most disappointing thing is Sam Peckinpah's directing which is so cold and mechanical you'd think Tony Scott made this . If you want Peckinpah at his best try THE WILD BUNCH , THE GETAWAY , or CROSS OF IRON . If you want Peckinpah at his most excessive try STRAW DOGS or BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA . And if you want Peckinpah on an off day then watch this . A very poor swansong for one of cinema's great mavericks
421337	2542703	90830	8.0	All the Lord's Children	Marlee Matlin's Oscar winning performance highlights this very good 1986 film . As a deaf mute , angry and frustrated with her life in silence , Matlin takes a job as a janitor in the School for the Deaf that she attended . The school is run by Philip Bosco , a savvy educator who really doesn't want to rock the boat . The latter could have been rocked by the coming of idealistic speech teacher William Hurt . Hurt gives a knockout Oscar nominated performance as he battles with Matlin along the way as the two fall in love with each other . As her estranged mother , Piper Laurie is convincing in a frustrated role that earned her a second best supporting actress nomination . The haunting musical score sets the tone for a marvelous film . It is interesting to see how Hurt works with deaf youngsters . The AFT should have considered giving him their teacher of the year award . The Motion Picture Academy seems to have a fetish for people with disabilities . Jane Wyman and John Mills joined Matlin in winning Oscars as deaf mutes . It is Matlin's performance though that deals with the subject of deafness itself without other incidentals .
450458	2093818	45888	7.0	Surprisingly enough , this is actually pretty good	I saw this movie because my father told me of a horror movie which scared the heck out of him and his friends when he was 16 years old . . . that movie turned out to be a Vincent Price movie . . . this one . After much searching , we finally found the film , and so we sat down to see the movie . He saw it in order to find out if he would still be scared by it , after all these years . . . I saw it in order to find out if it was really that good . My father tends to have great taste in movies , but occasionally he just gets drawn in by a theme or plot that he loves , and forget to think about the quality of the film . I must admit , I hadn't expected that much from the film . . . I was surprised by how effective and exciting it was . I haven't seen too many movies featuring Vincent Price , but now I may just have to . His acting was the best in the movie and he stole the show for every scene he was in . The plot is pretty good , though the story is pretty much just a reworking of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde ( gentleman by day , monster by night ) with a wax museum curator instead of a doctor . The pacing is very good . I was hardly bored for a second during the whole movie , which is surprising for such an old film . The acting is decent , with Price being the only actor to truly transcend above mediocrity with his performance . The characters are well-written and credible , with a few glaringly obvious exceptions ( you'll know them when you see them ) . The dialog is fairly well-written and interesting , not long-winded and dull as one might expect from a slightly unknown horror film from that time period . I can't help but compare much of the dialog to the dialog of more modern films , and immediately see that this film ( among others ) has had an impact on film-making that is still clearly visible today . That's quite impressive , I think . Only a few other films can claim that . The horror and suspense in the film is quite good , and there are plenty of genuine ( unforced ) scares in the film . . . Vincent Price really brings the character alive , and few have managed to startle me as much as him . The makeup work was quite impressive as well , considering the time it was made . The film has a few nods to Hitchcock , but they might have been coincidental . For such an old horror film , it's really good . It's rarely dull , has some good scares and the story is pretty good too . And if for nothing else , watch the film for Price's great performance . I recommend it to most fans of horror movies , as long as you keep in mind when the film was made . Don't expect too many intense cuts or a particularly original story . The base of the story is basically the story of Jekyll and Hyde . Keep that in mind , and you'll probably enjoy the film immensely , as I did .
439498	1617546	409723	6.0	Psycho Marching Band	A well-written and executed script manages to triumph over some mechanical line readings to produce an amusing short . I wonder about these Generation Y comedies . which seem to be about the oppressing need to succeed in over-blown instances of trivia . Are they satirizing high school relationships , where the politics are so vicious because the stakes are so low ? Are they satirizing the short-sightedness of the coming generation ? Or are they simply doing stuff that makes people laugh ? I hope it's that . None of the acting jobs , as I have noted , is particularly worthwhile , but for a quarter of an hour , you can skip great acting and life lessons . Read the posters in the background , instead . And Go Penguins !
495071	342623	35855	7.0	Nice entry into the Falcon series	Tom Conway is The Falcon in " The Falcon and the Co-eds , " a 1943 addition to the serial that also featured several recognizable actresses who appeared in B movies - Rita Corday , Isabel Jewell and Jean Brooks . Dorothy Malone is a co-ed and is uncredited . After a young woman appeals to Tom Lawrence ( The Falcon ) for help at her school , Bluecliff , where one suspicious death has taken place and a psychic student has predicted another one , she steals Tom's car to get him out to the school . Once there , he meets an interesting group of people , some of whom have secrets and others who act suspiciously . As foretold , another murder takes place , and it's up to The Falcon to sort things out . He usually does so before the police . This is a pretty good mystery with some obvious stealing from the film " Rebecca , " particularly the monologue about the sea that came right out of Danvers ' mouth - and for the same purpose as here . There is also an overabundance of establishing shots of the sea and its high waves . However , it's still an enjoyable film . Tom Lawrence is without an annoying fiancée , instead being followed around by three young women , the Ughs , who help him out as well as sing . Frankly , I prefer them . Conway isn't as smooth and debonair as his brother , George Sanders , but like his brother he has a beautiful speaking voice , is an attractive man , and flirts like crazy . His Falcon is more straightforward , and he's very likable . This is a very good series that always gives the viewer a relaxing hour-plus of watching .
470022	1532177	57076	7.0	Intelligent And Complex . Perhaps Too Much So !	This is an early Bond movie that is very intelligent and complex . After being defeated by Bond in DR NO , the criminal organisation SPECTRE devise a plan to bump off Bond while at the same time humiliating the British and Soviet intelligence agencies . The " problem " with this Bond film is that because it is so complex and intelligent it never really feels like a Bond film . Viewed beside DR NO and GOLDFINGER it never feels like it belongs in the same series and while it's certainly better than THUNDERBALL it's never as much fun as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE due to the sensible premise See it's the premise . Bond is never really given much to do , he's to meet a Soviet defector who has got her hands on a decipher machine and they've to meet a British agent on a train . At no point does anything ridiculously spectacular happen and you often think this is a story written by John Le Carre or a sequel to NORTH BY NORTHWEST . Oh don't get me wrong FRWL is much better than most of the Bond movies from the 1970s and 80s , it just never feels like a Bond film despite the appearance of a mad lesbian woman with strange footwear
568331	2721657	50722	6.0	We'll check every pool in the valley for a sign of their secretion	SPOILERS With a strong earthquake erupting under the Salton Sea in Southern California it opened up a hole where there were some prehistoric giant sleeping Mollusks . The Mollusks not only came back to life but started killing and eating a number of people and cattle in and around the sea . They then start laying eggs to bring and replenish their extinct species back to the point that they'll overflow the inland Salton Sea and work their way into all the waterways and oceans of the earth . Eating everything , man animal fish plant insect , on the planet into extinction . The US Navy having a top secret base on the southern tip of the Salton Sea and experimenting with atomic energy has a lot of explaining to do to the American people in the fact that the Mollusks are now a danger to the nation , as well as the very earth itself . The Navy had been fooling around with nuclear fission in and around the sea that caused , together with the earthquake , the mollusks to grow to such enormous sizes and breed like a bunch of sex starved rabbits . After losing a number of Navy men and some civilians along the sea the Navy goes out on a hunting trip to find these killer Mollusks . It soon confronts a number of them ending up capturing an unhatched egg of the creatures . With the commander of the naval base John " Twill " Twillinger , Tim Holt , in charge together with the head scientist Dr . Jess Rogers , Hans Conried , they place the egg in a temperature controlled tank at 38 degrees to keep the egg from hatching . The up-tight and by-the-books commander Twillinger get very friendly with one of the young women at the base secretary Gail MacKenzie , Andrey Dalton . Thats after finding here cute but somewhat bratty little daughter Sandy , Mimi Gibson , lost lady bug which leads to Twillinger finding an opening to Gail's heart . It turns that Gale lost her husband in a tragic naval accident two years ago . Twillinger takes Gale out to dinner where he spends more time looking at her then eating his meal . Meanwhile the deadly and giant Mollusks begin to fan out of the Salton Sea and move into a nearby canal . Killing and eating everything in their path including , in the most jarring scene in the film , an old and cranky canal lock operator , Ralph Moody . Who thought the story about these " Monsters from the deep " , that the Salton Sea Naval Station warned him about , was all a joke until he himself got swallowed by one of them . The Navy tracks down where the Mollusks are and where their laying their eggs and with Twillinger and Dr . Tad Johns , Max Showpher , donning naval scuba outfits they both go underwater and plant explosives in the Mollusks breeding grounds ; thus blasting them and their eggs to pieces . What Twillinger and the Navy forgot was that back at the naval stations laboratory there was still an unhatched giant Mollusk egg and little Sandy , being there with her mom Gail , decided to heat up the place by raising the temperature level of the water . That caused the Mollusk to hatch and go on a wild rampage . Exciting and nail-biting final with Commander Twillinger , or " Twill " to his friends , coming to the rescue of Gail and Sandy who both locked themselves up in a side room to escape the crazed earthworm-like mutation . Twillinger single-handedly holds off the mad and surging Mollusk with a fire extinguisher and then steam hose until the troops finally arrive blasting the slimy thing right back into the stone age .
498525	1355507	64519	5.0	" What I'm going to to tell you is bizarre , weird but it's the only theory that fits the facts . " Watchable enough , but dated Sci-Fi .	Doppelganger , or Journey to the Far Side of the Sun as I'm certain it's more commonly known as , starts at ' Eurosec European Space Exploration Complex Portugal ' where the boss Jason Webb ( Patrick Wymark ) reveals to the United Nations & American ambassadors that ' Sun Porbe 1 ' has discovered the existence of another planet on the far side of the sun on the exact same counter-orbit as Earth . Webb ask's the various nations to fund a manned mission to the planet to which the American representative refuses . Refuses until that is Webb reveals that his security team Lisa Hartmann ( Loni von Friedl ) & Mark Neuman ( George Sewell ) have discovered a Russian spy Dr . Hassler ( Herbert Lom ) leaking information , he soon changes his tune on the condition that an American astronaut is on the mission . Eurosec prepares for the mission , American Colonel Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) & his wife Sharon ( Lynn Loring ) arrive . Finally things are ready for take-off , Ross is joined by English astrophysicist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ) who face a three week trip to reach the newly discovered planet , coming out of their sleep they approach the planet & crash-land on it only to discover that it's Earth , or it appears to be an exact duplicate of Earth at first . . . Directed by Robert Parrish Doppelganger is an OK 60's Sci-Fi film that is a bit different if nothing else . The script by Thunderbirds ( 1964 - 1966 ) creators husband & wife Gerry & Sylvia Anderson along with Donald James uses every opportunity to stick in lots of Thunderbird inspired models of futuristic buildings , spacecraft & future technology & their about as convincing as those seen in an average Thunderbirds episode . Also the idea that an exact opposite of Earth exists is preposterous in the extreme , there are so many flaws with the idea it's untrue the biggest being why if EVERYTHING is reversed why don't the people on this new planet speak backwards , they write backwards so why not speak as well ? Because we , the viewer that is , couldn't understand them that's why . Nothing is done with the idea either , it takes over an hour of screen time to actually get to this planet & all that happens is Ross manages to convince Webb to let him go back home , yawn . Quite literary nothing else significant happens . Doppelganger is far too slow & simply not enough happened to maintain my interest between the Thunderbird model shots which look very out of place & awkward spliced into the live-action footage with the actors . The production design on Doppelganger is horribly dated , the colour schemes just check that shade of wallpaper out , the clothes with a hideous bright day-glo orange all-in-one dress & matching boots , the technology with supposedly futuristic computers that use magnetic tapes that spin around & the cars which look like their made from silver tin foil . The special effects are anything but & as a whole Doppelganger is a little bland . The acting is average & I never really cared for anyone that much . On the positive side it's different , it provides a reasonable amount of entertainment & is perfectly watchable in a silly undemanding sort of way . Doppelganger is OK but nothing spectacular , it will pass 100 odd minutes without too much trouble but won't grip or captivate many people & the whole premise is so stupid & flawed it never quite recovers , what was wrong with sending them to a planet with loads of monsters & aliens on it ? Average , don't bust a gut to see it .
559494	2626332	59903	4.0	What WAS A Good Comedy Is Only Moderate Entertainment , Today	I won't spend a hour writing an in-depth analysis of this movie , though I could . I will suffice it to review it from today's standards , and only on the surface . I'm not a fan of Woody Allen , though I do not despise his work , either . This screen play is a bit muddled , even by the standards of the time at which it was written , but today , it seems to have lost all edge , appeal , and charm . It is worth watching to see Sir Peter O'Toole as a devilishly young man who seems to suffer from a sexual dysfunction . Oh , not the kind you hear about today , but rather quite the opposite : he has too many encounters , and cannot seem to find a way to stop them from occurring . After the discovery of penicillin and before the AIDS epidemic began , sexual promiscuity was a moral issue , and not one of physical health . Today , this behavior is not only socially frowned upon , but can be life-threatening . Peter Sellers plays O'Toole's therapist , who is so enamored with O'Toole's problem , that he covets it for himself ! Under the circumstances of when this was made , this line was funny and amusing . Today's views , however , render this whole premise completely unenjoyable . This film , today , bears the same amusement level as one would experience upon discovering a beloved friend is voluntarily having sexual relations with someone diagnosed with AIDS . In other words , it's NOT . As I said , it is worth watching in order to experience O'Toole at a very young age . Otherwise , don't go in with too many expectations as the gags are dated , unintelligent tripe . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
554892	1406078	293116	5.0	Cellular	Danielle Thompson's film about two unlikely lovers is a bit of a puzzle . She has thrown together two of France's best known actors in a film that doesn't have a lot to say . Perhaps she is making a statement about France's frequent strikes that seem to bring would-be-lovers together ; perhaps she is telling us that strikes are sexy because there are endless possibilities of naughty things between virtual strangers . Juliette Binoche is practically unrecognizable as Rose , the beautician trying to escape a bad relationship . When she flushes the cellular down the toilet , her luck suddenly changes by asking Felix to use his own phone to finish her call . They keep meeting each other at the crowded terminal where stranded passengers have to wait until the strike is settled , perhaps . Jean Reno , is also playing against type ; his usual intensity is gone from the man he is portraying in the movie . Rose with the excessive makeup looks like a lady that entertains private male customers , cash only , please ! The film is light , but ultimately we know what is going to happen , so we're a step ahead of Mlle Thompson ! The only regret is that Sergi Lopez , the magnificent Spanish actor , is completely wasted as the man Binoche is running away from . Besides , better movies have been made about the subject . This is a film to watch in the middle of a transit strike , only ! Who knows , if one is caught up in a French transit strike , one can be lucky and be rewarded with such a delicious prize as Mlle Binoche !
515317	317399	412019	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Broken Flowers	Folks from my generation will always associate Bill Murray with Mr-stay-calm-know-it-all Peter Venkman from Ghostbusters , along with fellow comedians and collaborators Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis . Of late , he has been playing nonchalant characters , and probably would be better remembered for his role in Lost in Translation opposite Scarlett Johansson . Maybe it's his style , that he projects he's sleepwalking through his roles , And this written-for-him role in Broken Flowers as Don Johnson , oops , I mean Don Johnston ( with a T , there's a running joke about the Miami Vice fella ) , a Don Juan type character , seems to have cemented that opinion . Don changes girlfriends like he changes his underwear . Not that he wants to , but his character makes him a difficult person to be with . We're led to believe that he has made enough from his computer business , and is in semi-retirement mode , doing nothing but watch television at the comfort of his home . His latest squeeze , played by Julie Delpy , has left him ( gee what a cameo ) , and so did countless others before her . But the pace picks up slightly ( it moves terribly slow throughout the movie ) when he receives a pink envelope , and inside a typewritten note , telling him that he has a son from an affair twenty years ago , and that son is now on a road trip looking for his father . However , the writer doesn't sign off , there is no return address , and the postmark is faded . Putting it off as a prank , Don's best friend Winston ( Jeffrey Wright ) tries so hard to infuse interest and curiosity into Don ( he's always putting on the deadpan facial expression ) , before Don finally , and reluctantly , accepts the itinerary given to him . Which is to revisit his old flames from around that time , to determine if they have in possession a typewriter , which probably was used to type that anonymous letter . You might think that the premise is interesting , though nothing new , like Chris O'Donnell's The Bachelor , or John Cusack's High Fidelity , where the protagonist revisits his ex-lovers to discover various happenings and encounter various weird situations . Here , we have a load of talent playing Don's girlfriends from the past , like Sharon Stone , Frances Conroy , Jessica Lange , and even Tilda Swinton ( the White Witch from Narnia ) with dark hair . Winner of Cannes Film Festival 2005 , be warned that this film is an acquired taste , and may not appeal or be enjoyed by many . Firstly , the pacing is slow . There are plenty of moments where the plot doesn't propel forward , and shots just stay where they are . Almost every transition from scene to scene utilizes the fade-to-black technique , and each scene is surprisingly short . Perhaps these techniques fit the Don character like a glove , highlighting his short relationships with each girl , and his indifference to the outcome of each relation . We see that each girl has moved on with her life , some married , some having children , some already successful in their business , and all totally in contrast with Don's laid back character . It is during these scenes of character interaction that we get to experience some comedy , otherwise the other half of the time , we see the usual repetitive shots in airplanes or inside a Ford Taurus , as if to highlight the monotony of travelling alone . Though it's rated NC-16 for some nudity here , the only nudity you get is from a character called Lolita ( Alexis Dziena , who plays Sharon Stone's daughter ) , and that's only a butt-shot . The entire scene ( which I think is full frontal ) gets edited out , and along goes the dialogue with it , which somehow screws up the entire episode . There are nuances and implications towards the end of that particular visit which will make you go " Huh ? " . Pity . Given the crowd in today's screening , I don't think an M18 or R21 is gonna hurt box office takings ( school's reopening as well ) . Now , with that bad edit , I'm sure many will steer clear . The ending is open ended , and is totally up to your interpretation . My take would be that while one half of the mystery is solved ( or perceived to be solved ) , the other half of the mystery is still out there . And by leaving it as such , it paves way for discussion , which always enrich the experience of watching a movie .
395962	2483625	60120	5.0	The Appaloosa of Our Eye	The Appaloosa is a film that was made at a time when Marlon Brando's career was in the doldrums . Either films were not money makers though critically good like Reflections in a Golden Eye or they were outright duds like this one . It's not a horrible western , just not a terribly good one . Even Brando's One Eyed Jacks with a whole lot of posing was more interesting than this one . Brando plays a Confederate veteran come home to his Texas border town and the Mexican family that took him in as an orphan . He's got himself a nice Appaloosa horse that he hopes to breed as the start of a horse ranch . He also manages to come between bandit John Saxon and his woman Anajette Comer . Saxon gets his back up over it all so he steals the Appaloosa , leaving Brando to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico and track him down . All this over a horse , seems hardly worth the effort , we're not exactly talking about Trigger here . Brando and Saxon have a great old contest in trying to top each other in overacting . I leave it to your own judgment , but personally I think Saxon won the prize . Not Brando at his finest by any means .
366006	3109237	93300	2.0	" I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder . "	I am completely dumbfounded . What in the world were the people behind this mess thinking ? When the movie was over , Jaws : The Revenge left me with more questions than answers . Here's a laundry list of my questions : 1 . How did a movie as good as Jaws spawn this junk ? 2 . Regardless of where the shark is in the ocean , how is it capable of knowing the moment a Brody sticks so much as a big toe into the water ? 3 . If you attributed your husband's and son's deaths to a great white shark , wouldn't you want to go to someplace like Oklahoma instead of the Bahamas ? 4 . Do all Bahamians slip in and out of their accents the way Mario Van Peebles does in Jaws : The Revenge ? 5 . Could they have possibly made the shark look any more fake ? 6 . Snails ? 7 . You mean that piece of welded together scrap metal was supposed to represent all that is good about the Bahamas ? 8 . Do sharks really jump out of the water like Shamu and roar like a lion ? 9 . What's more frightening ? a great white shark or Ellen Brody's hair ? 10 . Is there a bigger acting whore on the planet than Michael Caine ? The best way to watch a movie like Jaws : The Revenge is with a group of friends . There's plenty here to make fun of .
367975	2707735	48584	7.0	" I don't like any Indians , I like half breeds less . "	John Payne's character spouts all the native Indian racist and anti-feminist diatribes he can muster in this wild west actioner taking place on a pack train to Santa Fe . Kirby Randolph ( Payne ) and his partner Sam ( Slim Pickens ) look to redeem themselves from a prior scouting job that ended in disaster for settlers on a wagon train passing through Cottonwood Draw . This might be the first time I've seen an Indian tribe actually get drunk on screen , as Randloph's attempt to placate Chief Satank ( George Keymas ) only gets him fired up for revenge . Credit the film makers with a significant historically accurate scene in which the main street of a Western town consists of about six inches of mud . You get to hear Payne in his role as the wagon scout refer to men required for point , swing , and drag duty . The film also has a great action scene involving a horse stampede that threatens the Griswold party , full of colorful sequences and quite well done . At the center of the story lies a romantic triangle involving Randolph , his boss Griswold ( Rod Cameron ) and Griwswold's partner and expected future wife Aurelie St . Clair ( Faith Domergue ) . The revelation of St . Clair's heritage as daughter of a Kiowa mother brings out a few more Injun clichés before the story's progress brings Randolph full circle in his thinking about accepting individuals on their own merits . By the time the Kiowa's make their final attack , Randolph can say " I won't have a squaw who won't take orders " with a nod , nod , wink , wink , and have St . Clair accept it with an understanding smile . The one thing that kept distracting me though was the casting of Irene Tedrow as St . Clair's aide Ptewaquin . I never quite caught on that she would figure in one of the story's twist endings , probably because I kept trying to figure out where I'd seen her before . Checking out her career credits , now I know . Best line of the picture - Satank describes the Mexican Chavez ( Anthony Caruso ) , ally of Griswold - " Don't like him , stink too much , like dead buffalo . " It conjures up as colorful a picture as the traitor McLawery ( Leo Gordon ) winding up as buzzard bait .
543736	562732	368447	6.0	It's all about the scenery .	I read one IMDb user's review of The Village which stated that M . Night made a mistake releasing The Sixth Sense because it made everyone in the world expect some earth shattering twist at the end of all of his movies , which is almost right . Luckily , this reviewer goes on to explain that M . Night has been trying ever since The Sixth Sense to recapture that awe that he created in his first major audiences , which IS right . In The Village , M . Night tries too hard to lead the audience in one direction that when we are brought back to reality it inspires an " oh , please " reaction rather than awe . I have tremendous respect for the immense film-making talent of M . Night Shyamalan , so I am not willing to fault him for making a weak film , but I am also not willing to see him create a weak film and then not say that it's a weak film . The look of it puts the time period sometime in the 1800's or an Amish community in Pennsylvania in the 1800s , 1900s , 2000s , etc . M . Night actually claims in the making-of documentary included with the DVD that the movie was set in the 1800s because he wanted to create an atmosphere of innocence . A small village of people seem to have been living under an agreement with some sort of malicious creatures that live in the woods that surround their village . They don't go in the woods , the creatures don't come out and hurt any of them . Because of M . Night's reputation for surprise endings , I doubt that many people read reviews of his movies unless they've already seen them . Even so , here is the obligatory spoiler warning ? SPOILER AHEAD ! What I like about the movie is that , while the twist is firmly in the realm of the ludicrous , it is at least very well explained , even if not ever credibly . There are vague explanations about how government officials have been paid off to prevent airplanes from flying over the village and terrifying the townspeople , no one is ever allowed to go into what is called an animal preserve , and in one of the last scenes , newspaper clippings reveal the suffering that many of the founders of the village have suffered , thus inspiring them to create it . I can certainly understand their motivations , especially since they have all suffered extremely , through the murders of loved ones , rape , burglary , etc . I live in Los Angeles and anytime I get a freaking parking ticket I just about want to move out of the country . But the problem is that they respond to their suffering by creating a society that is maintained by instilling fear in all of its residents . This fear is maintained much the same way that the fear of Voldemort was maintained in the Harry Potter stories . He is referred to as " He Who Must Not Be Named " by everyone except Harry Potter , who uses his name freely due to a total lack of fear . The creatures in the woods in this movie are referred to as " Those We Do Not Speak Of " as they are constantly spoken of in never-ending efforts to keep everyone scared . It is an interesting exploration of M . Night's technique , but the payoff is such a tremendous letdown that it is almost difficult to pay attention to the explanations that justify the possibility of the village's existence because of the disappointment . The movie is well made , the script is not .
459069	2467618	70707	8.0	very stupid , well-polished fun	Woody Allen's previous efforts , BANANAS and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN , were exceptionally funny but very uneven films . His being a bit of an amateur in the film business is pretty obvious in these movies . However , by the time he created SLEEPER , he was a lot more polished and consistent film maker . While this is still a very stupid and sophomoric film , it is very funny nevertheless . While there are occasionally bad moments ( such as the giant chicken ) , they are very few and the humor just keeps hitting you again and again . I particularly liked the Orgazmatron and the history lesson he gives the futuristic professors . This film is slapstick and dopey - - exactly the type of film that intellectuals ( the audience for most later Allen films ) will probably hate . This is Allen for the common man - - back when he used to be very funny .
421566	2542703	50682	7.0	Man on Fire - Give the Kid A Break !	Definitely a forerunner to " Kramer vs . Kramer " with Bing Crosby starring as a father who has custody of his young son . His wife ( Mary Fickett ) divorced him years ago for a Washington political person . Crosby is a successful businessman who has a wonderful relationship with his son . Enter mom and her husband who want custody of the child . Anne Seymour , in a one-scene restrained performance , plays the judge who surprises everyone with her decision to give the boy to his mother since the child has no ties with her . An embittered Crosby goes on a brief binge while being consoled by Inger Stevens , an assistant to his attorney played by the usual movie-lawyer E . G . Marshall . The film is interesting and well acted by all but my flaw with it is that the child is constantly bounced around as Crosby and Fickett fight it out . In addition , the Solomon-like decision did not apply here . If we remember our bible , the woman who was willing to see Solomon divide the child really didn't love the child at all , if she wanted this to happen . In the film , the mother finally relents as she sees that the child really wants to stay with his father and therefore , in the tradition of Solomon , she loves the child more . This is wrong and the writers of this picture should have read the bible more carefully . Naturally , everyone comes to his senses in this one by the end as a reasonable solution is obtained . One could question why this solution couldn't be put forth at the beginning of the controversy . Nevertheless , the film shows insight in its discussing the effects of divorce on children , the anger of one parent in particular and that a child should remain with the female parent . Yet , haven't we come a long way in equality for both parents ?
450423	2093818	103060	6.0	If you had trouble taking the first one seriously . . .	Entirely abandoning the little grittiness and atmosphere the first one did have , this embraces the approved-for-kids tone fully . Personality and threat , and thus engagement and excitement , are abandoned in favor of jokes intended for youthful offspring , and not even all being good ones , properly set up ones , or remotely original ones , at that . " Family films " might have less of a bad name if they genuinely tried to offer something , instead of just throw the lowest common denominator at the audience , hoping that they're either of the age where they find it funny without applying any criticism , or the parents of such , paying for the theater ticket regardless of quality . It is possible to create truly good ones , and ones that are still appreciated by the viewer . The real The NeverEnding Story ( of ' 84 , I do not acknowledge the others ) is a marvelous example . Wouldn't the children want proper adventure ? Perhaps even be challenged , at least a little ? Would fairy tales have the appeal they did if there were no consequences to people's actions in them ? The plot is far-fetched and squeals sequel ( it would scream it if it could , but the puns have gagged it ) . The pacing is uneven . The ending is unsatisfying . The acting is overdone , possibly intentionally . A new main character is introduced , allowing for more of the intolerable " shock at seeing something unbelievable " reaction shots , in case you didn't get enough of that in the one that precedes this , or the countless other movies that have such . The martial arts do have some nice choreography . The effects vary . The DVD holds a wide-screen and full-screen version of this , a theatrical trailer , as well as a reasonable mini-game , called Pick That Flick , where you , from a single frame , have to pinpoint which of the ten titles it is . I recommend this to fans of the Turtles , particularly younger ones , or those who of a mindset that fits with that group , it being at whom this was aimed .
526956	4445210	70680	6.0	OK , But Not One Of Burt's More Memorable Films	Although this was a fast-paced pretty interesting crime story , it was not memorable , which is probably one reason there are so few reviews here . Burt Reynolds was perfect for ' 70s film world of film in which just about anything was shown or heard now that all the restrictions were removed . Burt , as he did in this film , would sleep with any girl that came along . In one scene , Reynolds enters a bookstore , sees the clerk has a " nice pair of boobs , " so they have sex immediately right at the store . Only in the sleazy ' 70s of Hollywood ! ( Or in most men's dreams . ) Actually , Burt excelled in films that combined action and humor , which this has but not enough to make this one of more-remembered movies . However , it does have very little nudity despite the above paragraph and no blasphemy . The best part of the movies might be the final action scene which provides two laugh-out - loud scenes .
450341	2093818	218864	5.0	Stupid , juvenile and predictable	Just when I thought I'd seen the worst teen-oriented romantic comedies . . . this baby hits me . And when I say hit , I mean like a dropkick to my stomach . You may think you've seen it all , but you haven't seen this . . . and you should consider yourself lucky . Like Walt Becker's previous directing attempt ( which was about as big of a train-wreck as this one ) , this features Ryan Reynolds and has incredibly poor taste in humor and will disgust just about everyone who watches it , at one point or another . Granted , this isn't as sick or graphic as Van Wilder , but it's every bit as poor . Becker decides that his talentless direction isn't enough to torture us poor viewers , and tried to write the script for this mess . Luckily , he co-wrote it with Peter W . Nelson . . . who doesn't seem to have written another movie neither before nor since . I don't think I have to tell you just how poorly written the film is , as the direct result of this . The love story is contrived , sappy and unbelievably predictable . The acting is just bad . The characters are never credible , their actions make no conceivable sense and all of them are paper-thin stereotypes . The humor is so painfully obvious and stupid that I can't see anyone finding it funny . The jokes are poorly set up , never funny , and repeated to the point where we're sick of them . There's only one good thing about this movie , and it's Alyssa Milano as a stripper . If you consider that reason enough to see the movie , then be my guest . Lord knows that was the only reason I gave the movie any chance at all . I recommend this to fans of romantic teen comedies and Alyssa Milano . Anyone else shouldn't bother . In fact , if you doubt you would like it , then don't watch it . It's most likely not worth your time .
564340	102816	358294	3.0	Ain't got a Scooby	Some spoilers btw . This DVD has a major flaw . More than half the film's dialogue is in Japanese and the DVD does not have subtitles automatically burned into the screen . You have to turn them on , thus subtitling the English dialogue too . Of course , I only figured this out after watching the whole film and not understanding a single thing about it . Still , no subtitles can explain the utterly pointless opening scene that contributes nothing to the rest of the film or what purpose the FBI ' sidekick ' character Sean ( Matthew Davis ) served or why he was killed for finding a severed pinkie which the bad guy clearly did not want as he chucked it in a bucket right away . Why was Seagal's girlfriend killed ? What was the point in killing them if it didn't even motivate Seagal into actually doing something other than going from place to place asking questions , and getting answers , in Japanese . What was the main story ? Who was that lady following Seagal around ? My god , it's such a poorly written and poorly told story I can hardly believe it . I have liked none of Seagal's non-American movies of late . The Foriegner was one of the worst film's have ever seen . But this film does have strong production values , a more mainstream production team and a slightly cool final scene with bad guys getting chopped up and stuff but I still wouldn't recommend renting it , especially since the DVD is messed up and it's nowhere near as good as his older movies like Out for Justice or Under Siege 2 . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound and some pretty heavy punches during the fight scenes . Note to non-cockneys . Scooby = Scooby Doo = Clue
365968	3109237	36104	8.0	Very nice low-budget chiller from Val Lewton	Kiki and Clo-Clo ( I just love these names . ) are rivals in a nightclub act . To upstage Clo-Clo , Kiki's boyfriend arranges for her to enter the club with a black leopard on a leash while Clo-Clo is performing . But things don't go as planned and the leopard escapes . Later that night , a young woman is killed outside her home by a leopard . More deaths of women are blamed on the leopard . But is it really the leopard that's responsible for the deaths or is a maniac using the leopard as a cover to commit murder ? The Leopard Man has an unusual story structure that I find very appealing . Most of the events in the movie and most of the people ( or victims ) we meet occur through the movements of Clo-Clo . As she walks through the streets , she runs into or passes seemingly random persons . We are immediately taken into their world for a brief glimpse of their lives before the inevitable occurs . It's the realization that these people are unknowingly in danger because of a chance meeting with Clo-Clo and they can do nothing about it that creates much of the suspense in The Leopard Man . The Leopard Man features some of the best set-pieces and scenes Val Lewton ever put together . The death of the first girl , Teresa , is the most obvious example . To get home , Teresa must go through a tunnel knowing full well that a leopard has escaped and may be inside ready to pounce . This scene is nothing short of scary . It's one of the most frightening moments from a Lewton movie . Teresa finally reaches home but is unable to get inside the house . Before her mother and brother can get the door open , Teresa is attacked . The camera pans to the floor to show the blood running into the house . It's a very chilling moment and one of the best that Lewton ever made . Most of Lewton's films have a " look " to them that I find very pleasing . In this department , The Leopard Man doesn't disappoint . Everything from the " noirish " look of the city streets to the use of shadows to create atmosphere gives these movies part of their distinctiveness . Lewton couldn't afford fancy special effects or high-priced actors , so he made up for this by creating some of the most visually stunning movies I've seen . In short , The Leopard Man is a real treat to the eye .
433909	2171244	386741	6.0	Without death , life is meaningless .	If you liked Sin City , then you will want to check out this film . It is done in rotoscope , and has a film noirish hue to it , but the main weakness is the dialog . It features Daniel Craig ( Casino Royale , Layer Cake ) , Catherine McCormack ( 28 Weeks later ) , Jonathan Pryce ( Tomorrow Never Dies , the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy ) , and Romola Garai ( Amazing Grace ) . Voices only as it is motion capture . The film had a great look to it , but , like I said , the dialog was cheesy and really detracted from the story . Those who are comic book fans will find it interesting .
407906	865972	72662	8.0	Great giallo .	Looking for a way to get rid of his wife Nora , a wealthy womanizer blackmails a murderer into eliminating her . The assassin follows the plan the two men devised and brutally strangles Nora while her husband is whooping it up at a party with friends . The killer dumps Nora's corpse into the trunk of his car and returns to the house to remove any fingerprints . Upon returning to his car he discovers it's gone , along with the body of Nora ! It appears that two youths have stolen the car for a joyride unknowingly setting off a chain of events that will make them the next target for the now . . . " The Killer Must Strike Again " is a particularly effective giallo filled with a healthy dose of sex and violence . The structure of the film is quite unusual : for example Cozzi inter-cuts scenes of a young couple making love in a car with that of the killer brutally raping a young woman . Give this sadly neglected giallo a look . .
478943	463200	91790	7.0	OK John Hughes film	One of the many PG ( or PG-13 ) teen films made in the 80s by writer / producer / director John Hughes . This one isn't his worst ( " Some Kind of Wonderful " wins that ) , but it's not his best either . It's somewhere in the middle . A rich boy ( Andrew McCarthy ) loves a poor girl ( Molly Ringwald ) . She loves him also but is constantly being pursued by hyper Duckie ( Jon Cryer ) . McCarthy asks her to the prom . She accepts . But will his crowd accept her ? What is this ? In the 1920s-1950s I could believe this being made . . . but in 1986 ? ? ! ! ? ? Teenagers didn't care who was rich or not back then ( I should know - - I had a teenage sister in high school and she found the plot ridiculous too ) . It bothered me a lot in 1986 and it's still a bit of a sore spot today . Also the plot involves an older woman ( Annie Potts ) trying to help her and-sigh-her lovable , alcoholic dad ( Harry Dean Stanton ! ) - - talk about your clichés ! There's also James Spader on hand playing an obnoxious rich kid . All in all though , this movie isn't bad . It has a great soundtrack , some truly incredible 80s fashions and some of the dialogue is on target ( Cryer's one liners are very funny ) . But the acting is all over the place - - Ringwald looks bored - - the only time she comes to life is when she has to tell off McCarthy ( a wonderful scene ) . McCarthy looks VERY uneasy and the scenes between him and Ringwald are TERRIBLE ! ! ! Some of their lines had me staring at the screen in disbelief . Cryer , however , is very funny as Duckie . He wears truly ugly outfits but makes everything he says sound funny . His only really bad scene is when he dances and lip syncs to Otis Reddings ' " Try A Little Tenderness " . He tries to hard to be funny and it gets embarrassing to watch . Spader and Stanton sleepwalk through their roles . It is fun to see Kristy Swanson in a cameo , Gina Gershon ( ! ) as a teenage ( ! ) friend of Ringwald and Andrew Dice Clay as a bouncer ! SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! I agree with previous posters - - the ending is terrible . She should end up with Duckie . The original ending had her not going after McCarthy and staying in the prom . Test audiences hated that and it was quickly changed . I'd LOVE to see the original ending . Is it still around ?

407834	865972	404896	10.0	Wonderful horror film .	I saw this lovely piece of low-budget horror during Horror Fiesta Film Festival in Warsaw . This neat little horror flick is wonderfully entertaining and provides plenty of creepy atmosphere . Three teenage girls arrive to the Necropolis cemetery . Pearl and Lisl are the members of the so-called Crypt Club . The third girl , fifteen year-old Julie , tries to pass the test to become the member . As a midnight initiation to the Crypt Club she must find the grave with the sinister statue and put the stake deep into it . Soon all hell breaks loose . " The Crypt Club " is a lovely little horror indie with some creepy shots of the Necropolis cemetery . The soundtrack is extremely atmospheric and the film is well-made and acted . I can easily say that I enjoyed it very immensely , so kudos should go to its director Miguel Gallego . Three main characters ( the girls ) are convincing and the climax kept me on the edge of my seat . Check out this wonderful little indie . Recommended !
497643	1355507	182996	8.0	I love this cheap and cheerful horror film ! It's so gloriously entertaining in it's badness !	A woman ( Alma Ramas ) is murdered in a mountain stream deep in a remote Utah wood , the running water turns red with her blood . Shortly after a bird watcher ( McCormick Dalten ) has his arm chopped off with a machete and is also murdered . Meanwhile four young friends Peter ( Jack McClelland ) , Craig ( James Hayden ) , Ingrid ( Mary Gail Artz ) and Joanie ( Angie Brown ) are back packing through the mountains for a relaxing and fun few days in the wilderness . Back at the local town , the grossly overweight Sheriff ( Ken Carter ) and his Deputy ( David Barth ) have been getting lots of missing person reports . The Sheriff quickly dismisses them as nonsense . A man named Dale ( Dale Angell ) in the most garish horrible looking bright pink shirt and matching beret , along with his mother ( Ruth Grose ) is taking pictures of the beautiful scenery . They are both quickly killed by the as yet unknown psycho . The four back packers carry on deeper into the woods . After Craig , Ingrid and Joanie tease and make fun of Peter he decides to sleep on his own away from the others . That night more innocent people are killed . The next morning while by a stream on his own Peter sees a fisherman ( Hank Zinman ) killed by a ' wild man ' ( Tom Drury ) , we know he's a wild savage because he has a long beard , scruffy hair and makes funny noises . Peter rushes to warn his friends but it's too late as the maniac has butchered Craig . Will he be able to save Joanie and Ingid ? It certainly doesn't help when the three become separated . The maniac is in constant pursuit , who will survive and can the murderer be stopped before even more innocent lives are lost ? Directed by James Bryan I loved this film , it's just so entertaining , despite or should that be because of it's faults and all round awfulness . The music grates on your nerves after a while and large chunks of it appear to have been taken directly from an earlier horror film called Frozen Scream ( 1975 ) , the acting is bad and the whole film looks dubbed , the special effects are cheap but that's the way it should be , plus the editing and photography aren't exactly brilliant . The script by Garth Eliassen is great fun . It's never explained where the killer comes from or his motives for killing everyone he meets , and he doesn't say a word throughout the entire film which is just fine with me , who needs a story anyway ? There are so many people running around these ' remote ' woods it's unbelievable , roller skating chicks , artists , bird watchers , tourists , fishermen , ramblers , people making out in the back of camper vans and wheelchair bound cripples who think it's a good idea to travel deep into thick forest on their own ! The so-called twist ending is totally stupid as well , just like the rest of the film so I didn't mind in the slightest ! There are plenty of death scenes , people being hack up with a machete , people are impaled , decapitations , a painful looking death by bear trap , and being thrown off waterfalls , all with plenty of blood and gore , good stuff . Some very funny scenes in this too , like when Peter accidentally stabs a man thinking he is the killer only to keep saying " I'm sorry " over and over as he dies . And the two idiots in the camper van , Dick ( Frank Millen ) and Cherry ( Carolyn Braza ) who has the one of the biggest and crooked noses I've ever seen , and she's so dumb she can't even shut the doors on the camper van properly . A special mention goes to composer H . Kingsley Thurber who is credited with the closing song , to the tune of the ' the teddy bears picnic ' : " Don't go in the woods tonight , you probably will be thrilled . Don ' go in the woods tonight , you will probably be killed . There's a friendly beast that lurks about , and likes to feast , you won't get out . Without being killed and chopped up in little pieces . " You should hear how this guy sings this , it's absolutely hilarious and well worth watching the film all the way through to the end credits alone . Totally impossible to recommend as it's awful , but at the same time I just found it so entertaining to watch . A great ' bad ' film .
579143	583640	58036	8.0	Bugs Meets Taz , Take Four	This is the fourth and last Bugs versus Taz done in the 1960s and is almost as good as the first one was . Although most of the gags are visual ( including the closing one , a very good one indeed ) , there are verbal jokes as well and the dialogue is good . They made relatively few of these , I suspect because Taz's motivation was limited and therefore there wasn't anything they could do here that wasn't being done ( to better effect ) with the Wile E . Coyote and the Road-Runner series of cartoons . This one's very good and the ending is very funny ( unless you're Bugs Bunny ) . Recomended .
496941	1355507	427922	8.0	" That's basically how it was done . " Neat little & informative Doctor Who DVD documentary .	Synthesizing Starfields is a 9 minute 14 second documentary about the creation of the new Doctor Who titles & theme music that premiered during season 18 & were first seen on The Leisure Hive ( 1980 ) so it seems more than relevant that this documentary is found on that stories British DVD release . The opening titles & music to Doctor Who are surely some of the most instantly recognisable & iconic TV show openings ever & this is a great little documentary interviewing Sid Sutton who designed the titles & the new Doctor Who logo & Peter Howell who composed the theme music . There is archive footage featuring Howell from ' The Music Arcade ' a BBC schools programme from 1982 in which he demonstrates how he made the theme , the equipment he used & the individual tracks of music are played in isolation which when put together make the full theme . On a personal note I think Howell's theme music is the best in the show's history & although Sutton's starfield is a little bland they go together to make up one hell of a cracking opening sequence . Synthesizing Starfields has everything you would want I suppose , nice clear explanations of how the music & title sequence were made using black cardboard with holes in it , cardboard tubes fitted to cameras & ancient looking keyboard synthesizers amongst other things & their personal thoughts on their work which they seem proud of & willing to talk about .
461096	2467618	32828	7.0	has some excellent moments	Parts of this movie are great - - particularly those with WC Fields . In particular , I liked the horrible and cowardly way that he dealt with the attack on the train - - pushing hapless little kids with cap guns out the door to face the onslaught ! But , you'll no doubt discover that although this is a WC Fields and Mae West film , they don't interact much together , as they apparently hated each other and had to often be filmed separately . Mae's moments are generally flat compared to Fields ' as she once again plays the trampy old broad who every man MUST possess ( god only knows why ) . While the film certainly has some excellent moments , there are better films by Fields you can watch ( such as IT'S A GIFT , THE BANK DICK , etc . ) . As for West , this is probably a better than average effort from her as at least her character is slightly different than her usual 1930s fare .
406106	2020269	71617	6.0	A must see 70's gem !	A moody old song sets the right tone for what actually is a vastly underrated and extremely fun horror gem . " Homebodies " handles about a group of old folks banned from their houses and forced to abandon their familiar neighborhood in order to make way for new building projects . The drama this type of events causes is real but the emotions and action taken by these elderly are , of course , far over the top and deliciously absurd . The last mind strong tenants of an apartment complex go on a merciless killing spree and make everyone who tries to exile them disappear . Before turning into a complete pitch black comedy , " Homebodies " has a quite tension level and even an unsettling atmosphere at times . As illogical and exaggerated the premise may sound , these old folks look far scarier than any other serial-slasher in a funny mask . The character development of this film is simply great . Every single one of these mums ' n dads is intriguing , like the spooky blind guy or the lady who still talks to her long-deceased father . There are a few nice and bloody make-up effects and an endless amount of efficient black humor . Near the end , the story regretfully ( and maybe even inevitably ) loses some of its terrific initial impact as the female lead , played by Paula Trueman , turns entirely senile . The whole film turns senile with her ? Still , " Homebodies " ought to get more praise and recognition from the cult-chasing horror fans ! Recommended highly !
420950	2542703	62601	9.0	Laugh in Socked it To Us So Well	Fabulous television series running from 1967 to 1973 . What made the show so great was the lively supporting cast associated with it . The sketches with Arte Johnson as the old man starting up with Ruth Buzzi on the park bench were constantly hilarious . Who had the idea to put that net on Buzzi's hair ? It made her look so appropriately ugly . When she swung that pocketbook , we roared with laughter . Then we had Judy Carne saying " Sock it to Me ! " Remember when Richard Nixon said that famous line briefly on the show ? Dick Martin gave us that dead pan like humor and Dan Rowan portrayed the typical slick but constant smoking guy on the show . Joanne Worley was loud but so well suited for this continuous mayhem . I can't imagine how announcer Gary Owen was able to restrain himself from laughing . This show and " That Was the Week That Was " gave new dimension to television .
498663	1355507	86491	5.0	Disappointing anthology .	Twilight Zone : The Movie starts one dark night as two friends ( Dan Aykroyd & Albert Brooks ) drive along a deserted winding road , the tape player in the car breaks & they then have to entertain themselves at which point the subject of scary stories arise . . . William Connor ( Vic Morrow ) is a very bitter & angry man , he has just lost out on a promotion to a Jew & he is far from happy about it . He launches into a scathing & racist attack on non-Americans as onlookers from all races listen in disgust . William storms out but finds himself in Nazi occupied France where , as an American , he learns the harsh brutal reality about racism from the experts . . . Sunnyvale Rest Home , a place where the old go to live out their final few years of life watching T . V . all day . However Sunnyvale's latest resident Mr . Bloom ( Scatman Crothers ) convinces everyone your only as old as you feel . . . A schoolteacher named Helen Foley ( Kathleen Quinlan ) accidentally knocks a young boy named Anthony ( Jeremy Licht ) off his bike , he is OK but the bike is wrecked . Helen gives Anthony a ride home , once there she enters his house from which she may never leave if Anthony has his way . . . John Valentine ( John Lithgow ) is a nervous flier so when there is a violent thunder storm raging outside he becomes very nervous & is prone to panicking . As he stares out the window he sees a humanoid type creature ( Larry Cedar ) on the wing attacking the engine but no-one will believe his crazy sounding story . . . Taking the Twight Zone ( 1959 - 1964 ) name & basic premise this big-screen incarnation was a huge disappointment . The first mini story set in the car is decent & gets things off to a reasonable start but then things go down hill quickly . The first story was written & directed by John Landis & to my eyes is poor , the basic theme of racism & that it's bad & you shouldn't do it is very heavy handed & has no subtlety whatsoever . Add that to the on set problems in which lead actor Vic Morrow was killed in a helicopter accident which I'm positive altered how the segment was supposed to finish , as a whole the story has no punchline or twist & is extremely predictable . Imagine my surprise when I learned the second story was directed by Steven Spielberg because frankly this doesn't belong in a sci-fi / horror film as it's sickly , feel-good & sentimental nonsense that Disney would be embarrassed to put their name to . The third segment directed by Joe Dante is better but while it has a decent premise it goes nowhere & again where's the twist ending ? Finally it's George Miller's turn & this is far & away the best story but even then it's merely a rehash of an episode from the original series that starred William Shatner . As a whole the stories disappoint , there is very little horror & apart from the last one they are all very forgettable , having said that what's forgettable again I can't remember . . . This seems almost aimed at children , there's no gore & the scares are absolutely minimal . The last story has a certain something about it but the rest are dull , bland & lacklustre to say the least . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 Twight Zone : The Movie was a well funded film & in that sense it frustrates that more wasn't done . It's well made for sure but this has to go down as a wasted opportunity . The acting is OK & I have no problems in that regard but one has to feel for Morrow who was apparently decapitated along with two young children . . . Twilight Zone : The Movie was hugely disappointing , the fourth story is good but as I've already said it's nothing that wasn't done 20 twenty years prior back in 1963 when the original episode that it was based on was made . Very little to recommend here I'm afraid .
437070	306861	36269	7.0	The Tale Of A Hound & A Critter	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . It is PLUTO AND THE ARMADILLO he encounters that provides the excitement during Mickey's brief stopover in Belem , Brazil . This is one of the many films in which Pluto gets to interact with a small critter of some sort . The gags are routine . That's Brazilian star Carmen Miranda that The Pup spoofs for a few moments with the fruity headgear . Mickey's appearance is little more than a cameo . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
368489	2707735	63459	6.0	" I don't know what I've got , but I'm about to share it " .	Abbott and Costello may have wreaked havoc on more branches of the military , but they never tangled with two at the same time the way Bob Hope does in " The Private Navy of Sgt . O'Farrell " . A somewhat uneven comedy , the film makes do with Hope's traditional one liners and does the best it can with a supporting cast that includes Jeffrey Hunter , Phyllis Diller , and Gina Lollabrigida . At the center of the story is Sgt . O'Farrell's ( Hope ) plan to bring women and beer to the island base of Camp Funapee . Once accomplished with mixed results , the story meanders off to allow Hope's character to capture a Japanese submarine single handedly , and close out the story arm in arm with the lovely Maria ( Lollabrigida ) . As for the beer , I was surprised to see that it wasn't Budweiser cans floating all over the Pacific , but those of then heavyweight Milwaukee competitor - Pabst Blue Ribbon . It made me wonder if the Anheuser-Busch folks might have been given a shot at the picture . By the time the film really gets rolling , there's a can of Pabst in just about every scene . Being a long time Bob Hope fan , I can't recall today if Pabst was ever a major sponsor of his programming . But I sure do remember Texaco . Hey , did you catch the nod to one of Hope's earlier pictures ? All the men are on the beach drinking when the Indian private says to Hope - " Excuse me Heap Big Paleface ? " There's also that funny sequence attempting to reenact the beach scene in " From Here to Eternity " ; Hope even throws Lancaster's name out there in a bit of self deprecation . Also , if you were waiting to see if Crosby would show up , there's that clip of " Pennies From Heaven " to keep the streak going . Yet even with all the typical Bob Hope humor , he seems just a bit out of place in this late 1960's flick pretending to be one from the 1940's . This one approached the beach blanket bingo genre just a little too close for my comfort , and I prefer virtually any of his earlier efforts in glorious black and white . For my money , if I'm looking for Hope in a military setting , I'd just as soon tune in to one of his many USO entertainment specials . If memory serves , one of them would also have showcased Gina Lollabrigida and Phyllis Diller .

399141	1391795	79631	7.0	An intelligent and socially conscious picture undeserving of such critical venom .	In this adaptation of the Martin Cruz Smith novel ( co-scripted by Smith himself ) , Nick Mancuso plays Youngman Duran , a policeman with the Maskai tribe in New Mexico , who has more than one problem to contend with . Not only does he have to butt heads with Walker Chee ( Stephen Macht ) , who represents progress and new ways of thinking , but animals and soon people are succumbing to mysterious animal attacks . The culprits are vampire bats , and a Van Helsing of sorts , Phillip Paine ( David Warner , contributing a little class ) arrives to help save the day . Apparently , exterminating this species ( you'd think that would get him in trouble with environmentalists ) is his life's work ! This had to have been an odd choice of material for veteran director / former Academy president Arthur Hiller , known more for mainstream comedies and dramas like " Love Story " . It doesn't offer much in the horror department , however ; only an excellent bat attack set piece where one person is run over by a car and another set on fire is truly harrowing and nasty . It's really more of a social drama , as a modern day ( well modern circa 1979 ) Indian comes to terms with the clash between ages-old superstition and progress . Durans ' scenes with Chee really drive this point home , and Mancuso does a good job of creating a conflicted character . As one might expect from a movie in such a setting , there are some eye-popping vistas to enjoy , capably photographed by Charles Rosher , Jr . Henry Mancini also contributes heavily with a typically fine music score . The special effects by Carlo Rambaldi aren't too shabby , either . A fine supporting cast is worth noting . Kathryn Harrold is a likable and spunky love interest for Mancuso , the ever wonderful Strother Martin ( in , sadly , one of his final roles ) is a delight as an irascible store owner , George Clutesi is captivating as the aged and determined Abner Tasupi , and character actors Donald Hotton , Charles Hallahan , and Pat Corley fill out small roles nicely . It might be worth seeing this one alongside other socially conscious horror films from the same era that also had strong Indian themes , such as " Prophecy " and " Wolfen " . Now , granted , it's not some unsung gem , but I still think it's being judged too harshly . It's simply best if one doesn't look at it as being a pure horror movie , but a drama with some horror elements .
490522	33913	32376	7.0	Silly Film but what a cast !	Film director , Dorothy Arzner , was perhaps one of the first women directors in male Hollywood . Maybe her lesbianism helped in others forgetting that she was a female . Anyway this cast included Maureen O'Hara , Lucille Ball , Ralph Bellamy , and others who would have fabulous careers in Hollywood at the time . Dance , Girl , Dance is nothing more than a comedy and melodrama . Of course , Arzner's direction is not inspiring because she has such a wonderful cast . Who would have thought that Lucille Ball could have had a dramatic role for a change before her own hit show on television ? Maureen O'Hara is truly an Irish beauty who is still with us for now while most of the cast have gone to a better place . Dorothy Arzner paved the way for other women directors , lesbian or not , to put their stamp on Hollywood . Sadly , this film is not the greatest or worst film of all time but you can still watch it and debate on whether women have come so far in Hollywood .
573053	4248714	136640	5.0	The Forgotten Toys	If you've seen the mini Christmas movie then you would know what this is , it's basically a TV series about the teddy bear and doll still on the lookout for new kids to be owners . Joanna Lumley is still the okay Annie ( or " Pigtails " to Teddy ) the doll with her ragged skirt , and Bob Hoskins is still the lovable and humorous Teddy . Throughout the series they had many interesting adventures . They tried to be won at a fayre , they caught some burglars , they were stolen by a horrible kid and many more . To be honest I didn't watch it all the time , but when I did it was pretty okay . Bob Hoskins as Teddy is just the best part of the whole show . Worth watching !
407227	865972	375731	3.0	Slightly amusing piece of utter trash .	The back of my DVD describes the plot of " El Chucabra " : after his capture in the wilderness , the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra escapes into the city creating mayhem and panic . As they pursue the deadly beast , an animal control officer and scientist Dr Starlina Davide realize that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan is also tracking the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolical Dr Goodspeed . This putrid horror flick is somewhat amusing , if you watch it under the influence of alcohol . The script is completely silly , the acting is wooden beyond belief and the direction is amateurish . Two rubber Chupacabra suits are easily the best thing about this movie . and that's being extremely kind .
368126	2707735	99612	6.0	" Meet . . . . my monster ! "	Trying to deal with time travel stories often makes my head hurt , because it sets up a whole set of ' what if ' scenarios . For example , when Dr . Buchanan ( John Hurt ) produces Mary Shelley's ( Bridget Fonda ) book " Frankenstein - or , The Modern Prometheus " , wouldn't natural curiosity have compelled her to read the story she hadn't written yet ? And in doing so , wouldn't she have changed certain parts of the story , or even added the character of Dr . Buchanan into it ? One's mind reels at the possibilities . Focusing on that aspect of " Frankenstein Unbound " would have been provocative enough , but the film gets deeper into science fiction territory with Buchanan's particle beam weapon and it's side effects of missing persons , time slips and weather disturbances . The number of throwaway scenes that did nothing to propel the story forward surprised me , starting with that warrior on horseback that appeared when the youngsters were burying the outmoded bicycle . Buchanan himself hallucinates a couple of dream sequences that don't connect to anything and have no bearing on what eventually happens . Dr . Frankenstein ( Raul Julia ) is an interesting character . Disturbed and protective of his creation at the same time , it's ironic that he takes no responsibility in the face of an innocent girl's death by hanging for the murder of his younger brother . To him , his only rationalization can be - " I'm a scientist , I cannot sin . . . " Probably a plus , the film doesn't dwell on the creation of The Monster , he's certainly creepy enough without appearing to be a patch job of multiple bodies ; to this viewer he calls to mind my vision of the Swamp Thing . Ironically , the transformation of Elizabeth into the Bride of Frankenstein is visually stunning and a closer tribute to the original in her brief appearance . Ultimately though , it seems the film stumbled around to come up with an appropriate ending and I'm not so sure that was achieved . The character of Buchanan was just as much a villain as Frankenstein and The Monster itself , so having him wend his way far off to the futuristic city just left me with question marks . Perhaps that was meant to be his punishment , along with making him walk instead of taking his trusty talking carriage .
442957	819382	104427	6.0	Man of honor .	I would guess that many people find Jack Nicholson as satisfying as I do because , like Cary Grant , he always seems to play an only slightly refracted version of the same character . Those leaping eyebrows , like twin Mount Raniers on his forehead . That toothy grin , sardonic and sadistic . Here , though , he gives all that up and becomes a different and highly energetic Jimmy Hoffa . His lips are tucked in , his head held back emphasizing the folds in his neck , and he wears an almost constant scowl . His voice too lacks the expected sleazy glissandos of the Nicholson School of Elocution . His speech is clipped , fast , and full of working-class grammar . ( " All these rumors are unsubstantuated ! " ) He does a great job as Jimmy Hoffa . And Danny DeVito is great as always , playing Hoffa's old-time buddy , Bobby Ciaro , a clown with a potential for deadly seriousness . Nicholson and DeVito grew up in the same town - - Neptune , New Jersey - - at about the same time and have known each other for years . DeVito claimed to have dated Nicholson's sister . It's pleasing to see the two of them working together . In some ways , though , the whole may be less than the sum of its parts . The story is a bit like that of " The Godfather " but without the Mafia mystique . Hoffa starts out good but then - - well , what ? Does he go bad ? If so , the movie does as good a job of hiding exactly what he did as Hoffa himself did . There is a scene in which he seems to agree to lend money from the Teamster's Pension Fund to " a known Italian . " But the scene takes place during a faux deer hunt and is played for laughs . While D'Allesandro ( Armand Assante ) and Hoffa argue over the terms of the loan , a deer walks up unexpectedly and is ignored by everyone until , finally , DeVito uncorks his automatic and blasts it . When the shots sound everyone hits the dirt . The scene is amusing but it's distracting too . What WAS that agreement , exactly ? Is it illegal for the President of a labor union to lend money to someone else at a profit ? Hoffa claims not . And who argues with him but Robert Kennedy , played very unsympathetically as an elitist snot who never worked in his life and is just trying to make a name for himself by bringing Hoffa to court . Hoffa , eventually is convicted and goes to jail . But it is never made clear exactly what he was convicted of . Lending money to an Italian ? Nicholson plays Hoffa pretty straight . He's not a particularly nice guy but he's clever in the way that an alley cat is clever . ( Mamet's dialog stays on track . ) Yet the director , DeVito , gives him the almost same kind of sentimental treatment that Don Corleone got . I am happy , though , that the movie spared us scenes in which Hoffa's wife sobs and complains that he's so often away from home that she hardly knows him anymore . ( Thanks again , Mamet . ) There is a fictional but still unnerving assassination scene at the end . Hoffa and DeVito's bodies are dumped atop one another in the back seat of their car . The car is driven up the ramp of a waiting truck and the truck zooms off down the highway towards its unknown destination . Elegiac music swells on the sound track . The image of the back of the truck recedes and dwindles until it disappears down the highway , a setting sun hovering just overhead . Did Hoffa really deserve this Viking's funeral ? I don't know . The movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions , none of them about the performances . A viewer can't help wondering where Hoffa is now . Part of a building somewhere , or an automobile ? Or a truck ?
448084	1048771	71598	6.0	Harry and his Tonto . . . another buddy flick but with a difference . . .	ART CARNEY and his orange tabby take a cross-country odyssey when he loses his lodgings in a rundown NYC building being converted to a garage . He leaves his friendly , somewhat eccentric friends in his neighborhood , makes a brief stab at living with impossible relatives and then heads for the open road again . He's independent in every way except one - - he won't live without his cat Tonto either at his side or in tow . The situations are a little extreme . He disembarks from his bus ride so that the cat can relieve itself and then can't find Tonto when the cat runs off . He does find his cat and they continue their journey , meeting up with a few other kookie characters on the way . 56 year-old Carney , in age make-up , does a remarkable job of holding audience interest while he spends much of the time addressing his remarks to Tonto . Geraldine Fitzgerald has a nice bit as an old flame , now in an old age home . Nothing deep here . His most philospophical comment is : " Did you know that the strangest thing about being old is , all your friends are dead . " There's also a priceless moment when his nephew , Norman , who never says much , responds to ELLYN BURSTYN , " I love you too , Aunt Shirley , but you're a such a bitch . " Some editing would have trimmed the last half of the movie to a more suitable length . Two hours is a bit much for this kind of slight tale . Considering some of the great male performances that were up for Oscars that year , Carney's win is surprising . It's a rather one-note , one dimensional role - - although he makes the most of it . Good , but too many rough edges - - not quite as heart-warming as I expected it to be .
493108	3280905	26422	6.0	Tex Avery's First Cartoon as Supervisor	A mildly amusing 1935 cartoon that was replayed yesterday on Turner Classic Movies . Beans was briefly ( very briefly ) the leading figure in Merrie Melodies , before his lack of any humorous comic personality suggested that he really did not deserve such an exalted position . He is one of the gold miners in Red Gulch , California in 1849 ( hence the title - a joke supposedly on the popular Warner " Gold Digger " Musicals ) . His girlfriend is the daughter of Porky Pig . At this time Porky's size and personality were still up in the air . He is taller and fatter ( and quite honestly gluttonous ) in this cartoon . Beans brings back gold to the town and a rush starts . The town empties out . One racist joke in the film : a Chinese pair are riding a rickshaw ( one is pulling it ) when auto fumes ( this cartoon has several anachronisms in it ) turn them Black , and one starts talking like Amos and one like Andy . When a villain lassos Porky's tied bag , the latter says Beans can marry his daughter if he gets the bag back . He eventually does , in the course of changing his his old Model T into a streamlined racing car to catch the villain . As I said mildly amusing . The future touches of genius that Avery brought to his cartoon work in the 1940s are not found here . But he had to start somewhere , I guess .

This would have been OH so much better with Harrison Ford in the lead . This is the kind of movie he needs to be doing now that he's just too " mature " for action . Gods help and forfend when he stars in Indiana Jones 4 . Richard Gere was good , even believable , as the " Times " reporter who ends up in West Virginia to do an investigative piece on mysterious happenings there , but Harrison Ford would've been brilliant in this one . Some horror fans are of the mistaken impression that the creature element in this movie is a " new monster . " In fact , this is a very old monster , which has received very little press , so to speak .

I have to say that she still has some good moves at 40 and still has one hot bod . Just seeing her smash some bad guys is worth the buck . But , she has slowed down considerably , so don't expect Jet Li action , and the schoolgirl giggling at 40 is really off putting . Don't expect anything in the way of dialog in the picture . The premise is as corny as Ghost Whisperer and the acting is terrible . She needs to get a scriptwriter that has graduated from high school and knows more that BIFF ! POW ! BAM ! The attempt at humor several times in the pic were lame , and " I'll show you mine , if you show me yours , " is bad even if it is karate they are talking about . Hell , it was just a buck .

447334	1048771	25850	5.0	Antiquated Warner musical is short on charm . . . creaky is the word . . .	Despite a competent cast of players and the Vitaphone Orchestra doing their best to give the music a turn-of-the-century beer garden sound , SWEET ADELINE does nothing to indicate that musicals would find favor with the public in a big way . The old-fashioned Broadway play has been fashioned into an old-fashioned early ' 30s musical with absolutely no distinction , either in the musical numbers themselves or the lackluster storyline . It's all strictly cornball and very , very hokey . I'll leave a description of the story ( which takes place in 1898 ) to others who have already given a detailed synopsis . Suffice it to say that only the most ardent fans of IRENE DUNNE would be willing to sit through this one patiently enough . She does get a chance to lift her voice in song a few times but the result is , to put it charitably , very modest , nor are the songs anything to cherish . DONALD WOODS , a handsome actor usually confined to supporting roles , is the lead and relies on earnest glances at Dunne to carry his role . It's not enough . Some below par humor is supplied by Hugh Herbert and Ned Sparks . Summing up : Stands alone as one of the least entertaining musicals of the ' 30s - - bad script , dated material and forgettable songs .
438267	306861	15310	10.0	A Splendid Silent Swashbuckler	A brave English knight , betrayed by his brother , kidnapped by pirates , and captured by Spaniards , takes up a new identity under the Moors as ' Sakr-el-Bahr , ' - the Sea Hawk - to become the scourge & terror of the Spanish navy near Gibraltar . Although sadly neglected for years , this is a splendid swashbuckler , full of action & romance , which should please the fans of silent cinema adventure . Much more faithful to Rafael Sabatini's original novel than the Errol Flynn 1940 version , this is a film which can stand on its own worthy merits . Given excellent production values by First National , the rousing sea battle sequences are especially worthy of mention . Using full scale ships , they possess an aura of authenticity not possible with models . Indeed , some of these nautical scenes were extracted for years for use in other films . Milton Sills gives a grand performance as the hero . Although lacking in bravura athletic skills , he becomes almost Fairbankian by the film's conclusion . ( He even resembles Fairbanks in the shipboard scenes , surely no mere accident . ) Appearing in movies since 1914 , this was the film which made Sills a major star , and he would be given other popular , courageous roles before his career - and life - were ended by a heart attack in 1930 , at the age of 48 . Although he had appeared in 85 films , Milton Sills is all but forgotten today . Beefy Wallace Beery , blustering & bullying as usual , steals all his scenes as a pirate captain who becomes Sills ' toady . Enid Bennett is beautiful as the young Cornish woman beloved by the Sea Hawk . Lloyd Hughes gives a good performance as Sills ' faithless half-brother . Wallace MacDonald is the very picture of a violent young bully . Lionel Belmore appears briefly as a friendly magistrate . Elderly Frank Currier & young William Collier Jr . both do well in roles that exude Moorish duplicity . Quick eyed movie mavens may spot George O'Brien as a galley slave . Although the film has been tinted & toned , notice the nice extra touch during the 3 shots of the Basha's nighttime visit to the Sea Hawk , in which the flickering torches have been hand colored a theatric yellow . Composer Robert Israel has given the film's restored print a very fine organ score which interpolates familiar melodies from as far afield as Gilbert & Sullivan .

The country is so desperate that every year it holds a mad scientists fair to come up with new invention with which to blackmail the rest of the world . Igor is of course the smartest one going but since he's the assistant no one listens to him . When his boss is killed , Igor sees this as the opportunity to step into the spot light with his invention . An uneven movie with lots of great things floating around in it ( Steve Buscemi's Scamper , an immortal bunny who keeps trying to kill himself since he sees there is no point to life or Eva's brainwashing going horribly wrong because someone changed the channel ) . The problem is that it doesn't hold together completely . Its as if it needed another draft or two to bring everything into sharper focus . The film could have used a less derivative design since many characters look like the belong in the Nightmare before Christmas . Yes the voice cast is great from Johns Cleese to Eddie Izzard ( as Dr . Schadenfreude , the Elton John superstar scientist ) to Buscemi , I just wish they had a more formed tale to give their talents to . Worth a look at some point ( it will develop a cult because of the things that work )

409459	2567136	56838	8.0	Decibel Points	Pierre Chenal belongs to that band of French directors - though technically he was Belgian - who turned out a solid body of work mostly in the thirties / forties / fifties and are now all but forgotten , think of people like Marcel L'Herbier , Albert Valentin and you'll know what I mean . Personally I've always had a soft spot for Chenal's L'Alibi though some find it has dated badly . L'Assassin was arguably the last decent film he made though he did make two more , the second as late as 1984 , that needn't detain us here . This is our old friend the Black Comedy and it's as fine an example as most . With a genre like this you need a central hub from which to spin off the mounting improbabilities and in this case that hub is Paul Meurisse , a composer with a deadline to produce a symphony and a noisy garage beneath his window . He thinks he's solved his problem when he meets , purely by chance , a pious air-head , Maria Schell , who offers him the use of her rural retreat as you do to complete strangers . He takes her up , naturally and this , equally naturally , is only the beginning of his troubles . There's a beautifully wacky take on the scene in lots of thrillers when someone shoots a guy then puts the gun in the corpse's hand to make it look like suicide . In this case , Meurisse , exasperated by Schell's father , Noel Rocquefort , who cheerfully insists on building a boat noisily , takes a hammer and beats him to death , unintentionally of course , then realizing he's gone too far , puts the murder weapon in the victim's hand but the topper comes when an ' expert ' called in by the police declares that Yes , you could top yourself with several blows from a hammer where they would do the most good . And this is in the first thirty minutes after which it continues to spiral out of control for another forty five minutes or so . Definitely worth seeing .
487355	386241	361620	5.0	Unchallenging fluff	One thing I noticed right away about " First Daughter " is that Forest Whitaker ( a great actor , by the way ) has a decent sense of visual style . So perhaps he should choose more challenging material for his next directorial effort - after all , there is only so much you can do with a script like this , where everyone says and does exactly what you expect them to say and do ( though I admit that Keaton's President is a little " nicer " than expected ) . Katie Holmes is sweet and engaging ( when she doesn't try too hard ) , but this fluffy role is beneath her abilities . The real discovery here is Amerie Rogers , who gives a wonderful performance as Holmes ' roommate , but strangely enough the movie doesn't seem to care very much what happens to her . And one last observation : why is this movie so long ? It feels like it runs about 4 hours ! ( )

How is it as a movie ? Well , it's a PRC production , which means that it's done on the cheap and lacks any signs of subtlety .

577900	1399158	43018	7.0	SUSANA ( Luis Bunuel , 1951 )	Last Sunday night , I was simultaneously listening to the Oscar ceremony over the Internet and recording this film being broadcast on Italian TV but shown in the original Spanish language . Every now and then I gave cursory glances at the TV , which I kept on but had the audio turned off , and couldn't help feeling that it seemed to me that SUSANA would be a very minor work from my favorite film-maker . Indeed , a minor film it undeniably turned out to be when I finally watched it yesterday ? which I didn't do earlier simply because my 28 " TV was bust all this week ! ? but , then , despite its lowly position in Bunuel's canon ( check out my personal ranking in " The Great Director's Checklist Series # 39 " ) , I couldn't help agreeing with what Vincent Canby wrote about it either : " SUSANA is full of the sort of Bunuelian touches that forever separate all of Bunuel's films , the potboilers as well as the classics , from those of everyone else " ! Anyway , here's my take on the film : though it never reaches the heights of the director's best work from his Mexican period , let alone his greatest , which runs from 1961 through 1977 , it's so focused in following through the deceptively simple plot line - which was allegedly inspired by Alexander Korda's THE SQUALL ( 1929 ) , co-starring Loretta Young and Myrna Loy , and which also reminded me of Jean Renoir's even more anarchic BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING ( 1932 ) and Pier-Paolo Pasolini's obviously more pretentious THEOREM ( 1968 ) - that it becomes a compelling viewing experience , even if in a low-key manner . Bunuel brings to the inherent melodrama his typical preoccupation with the rules and regulations which govern bourgeois lifestyle as well as the religious hypocrisy so crucial to maintaining its respectable façade ? but never for a moment does he forsake the technique which is required to put across all his points . In fact , SUSANA features effective shadowy lighting throughout , thus ensuring any number of striking compositions and scenes : 1 ) the very opening sequence with the rebellious Susana being dragged into solitary confinement hissing and spitting at the prison guards2 ) the shadow made on the ground by the cross-like bars in Susana's prison cell ( which she shares with an assortment of bats , rats and spiders ) ; she casually prays to God for deliverance , since she cannot help being who she is , after which Susana is able to effortlessly remove the bars and escape ! 3 ) Susana's face suddenly appearing at the window of the hacienda during a stormy night4 ) the pan across the courtyard of the hacienda showing Susana's room being watched by all her three admirers at the same time , without them knowing of one another5 ) Susana being violently flogged by Dona Carmen , when she realizes that the girl she has taken in out of kindness has disrupted the harmony of Don Guadalupe's home with her uninhibited behavior6 ) Susana being literally dragged out of the hacienda back to prison by the police officials Besides , Susana's constant dressing-down ( provocatively and purposefully exposing herself ) before appearing in front of the males of the household , is very amusing ? as is the put-down , at every opportunity , by them but also Dona Carmen , of the bible-thumping servant-woman who warns of Susana's deceptiveness from the get-go . The love scenes are pretty discreet but those involving the studious young son of the family take place in unconventional settings such as the library of the hacienda ( where the couple could be discovered at any moment by his God-fearing mother ) and inside a well , in which Susana purposely throws herself in order to be ' saved ' ( the rugged but equally enamored foreman then appears and , sensing their presence , throws in a rock after them ) . While the cast doesn't feature any stars , as some of Bunuel's later international films would , the three main roles are admirably filled ? Rosina Quintana as Susana , at once sultry and captivating ; Fernando Soler as the authoritative yet gullible Don Guadalupe ; and Matilde Palou as his long-suffering but indomitable wife . I would also like to say something about the assertion made by Ed Gonzalez in his review of the film ? which appears in " Slant Magazine " ' s section on the director entitled " The Savage Poetry Of Luis Bunuel " ? that there is an overt connection between Susana's voracious sexuality and Don Guadalupe's prize mare ( which is , apparently , sick and unable to breed during Susana's tenure at the hacienda ) : I wasn't aware of it at the time so it didn't bother me as much , though I obviously wouldn't put it past the film-maker to have intended just such a link . Finally , the so-called " cop-out " ending ? wherein everything goes back to normal ( the mare miraculously recovers and the dismissed foreman , who leads the police on the girl's trail , is reinstated ) , once the threatening presence of Susana has been vanquished , is nothing more than one last jibe by the director at our inherent complacency and the mistrust we show in the face of anything that would in any way alter our status quo . In fact , I tend to agree with Tom Vick who , in the " All-Movie Guide " database , wrote : " SUSANA's pointedly insincere ' happy ' ending is one of { Bunuel's } funniest " .
435806	9938570	71629	5.0	House on Skull Mountain	Relatives are sent a letter , an invite to come to the Southern mansion , on the outskirts of Atlanta , of a voodoo priestess , who has died , expecting them to ward off an evil they do not know . Each person , the foxy attractive Lorena ( Janee Michelle ) , smart-mouth , obnoxious Phillippe ( Mike EVans of " The Jeffersons " ) , polite , mannered Christian Harriet ( Xernona Clayton ) and the unlikely " honky " of the group , an anthropology professor , who has studied voodoo , Dr . Andrew Cunningham ( Victor French of " Highway to Heaven " and " Little House on the Prairie " ) , haven't even met their ancestor . While it appears this group is gathering for a will reading , they are instead in for a battle against the creepy butler , Tomas ( Jean Durand ) , secretly practicing voodoo rituals in a hidden room below the mansion using his abilities to endanger their lives . It'll be up to the unlikely heroics of Cunningham , who definitely sticks out like a sore thumb in this mostly African-American cast , and his knowledge of voodoo , to stop Tomas who wishes to strengthen his powers by marrying Lorena , a mostly pure Christophe . Voodoo horror outing even has a musical ritual performed by practitioners in that cavernous den below the mansion . There are skulls aplenty , which I admired , such as the face on the mountain where the mansion resides and on the door that greets visitors . Even Death pops up every once in a while to point towards potential victims . The climax even has Pauline Christophe ( Mary J Todd McKenzie ) rising from the grave , by order of Tomas which adds some fun to the proceedings . I think this kind of horror film , which gives over to the supernatural elements of the practiced religion , might make many viewers chuckle instead of fold into their seats . The cast is okay , nothing mind-blowing , but just the audacity to have a white hero is something to create interest for this kind of unusual horror effort . Not a bit violent , this was suppose to spook , not disgust . The setting , I loved a great deal . . the mansion is quite a stunning set . I thought the ending where Tomas and Cunningham square off in a sword fight was a bit hokey , though . I'm not sure whatever happened to the participants of the voodoo dance once Tomas accidentally slices a skull , ritualistically placed on a stick which holds Lorena hypnotically imprisoned . You have to gloss over flaws like that when a film allows liberties regarding the power of voodoo on innocents .

428885	3079504	1175491	8.0	Masterful look at the interior life of a man in the White House	Oliver Stone's film about the life of George W Bush seems to be a simple look at the life of W from his college days to the invasion of Iraq and how it all went wrong despite the best efforts of our central character . The film doesn't deal in a great deal of details , it does not follow every minute of every event-in deed the films present ins the days leading up to the invasion , and then flashes back to seeming " key " moments in Bush's life , some seemingly innocuous . However they are not innocuous they are somehow key to the interior landscape of the man . It is that interior landscape that is important to the film , not the details of everyday life . Look at how the film shows us the people in Bush's life . They are all drawn in a simplified way that Bush sees the world . His father is the master he can't please ; his mother is loving but on the fringes ; Laura , at first is a challenging three dimensional woman who recedes into the cheer leader and prop ; Cheney the man who wants to have his way ; Rove the brain ; Colin Powell , the complex voice of reason that no one understands and who gets ignored because he's the smartest one in the room and its easier then dealing with the reality he puts forward . But the way the film is put together there is a second level there , we have the people existing in the way that Bush sees the world but we also have the times when there is another level . Watch the performances watch how what some one says indicates one thing but how they act indicates something else . Look at how Laura recedes and her role becomes more and more the " mother " or prop up for George her body seems to indicate much more going on ? we don't see the more overtly because George doesn't . This is a film about how Bush sees the world , not how the world sees him . ( why else do we keep having Bush go back to centerfold in the baseball stadium , its Bush escaping ) . Many have leveled charges against the film in that it makes Bush too likable and that its not tough enough in judging him . First off how could George not come off as likable to some degree . One can't become elected to the presidency without someone liking him . There has to be something there that makes people want to follow him , or at least have him lead them . As for not being tough enough , I don't think that's the point of the film . It wasn't made to be a witch hunt , rather it was to show us what sort of man the man who lead us for the eight years was and how that lead us to where we are . The film does have a great deal to say about those around our commander and chief , and its not very pleasing with pretty much everyone in the cabinet , except Powell getting raked over the coals . To be certain the film might have been tougher on them , but then again the film isn't focused on them and their deeds or misdeeds . As the film stands it's a close to great film . First because it has everyone annoyed at how it portrays its main character . If Stone had pleased everyone then there is no doubt he did something wrong . So add it to the list of Stone bio's that have rankled the populace . Stone has made a film that makes you think . Whether you like it or not the film will challenge your perceptions and force you think about what you are seeing ; you will be forced to think about what Stone is showing you and wonder why . And while its looks simple , its not simplistic , there are no real easy answers . Its a film that will require multiple viewings . I knew near the end that a second viewing was in order since I was only just beginning to understand what I was seeing . And the film's greatness comes from the performances . Everyone is very good in their roles , especially Josh Brolin who eerily inhabits the persona of George W Bush in ways that are scary . One pretty much forgets that its Brolin up there on the screen by the time the film is a half an hour old . One can hope that at the very least an Oscar nomination will be coming his way . If there is any real flaw it is the one noteness of Bush's vision . I can't fully blame Stone for making some the characters so one note , particularly James Cromwell as George Bush Sr since the black and white nature of the world is key to under standing how the world operates . " I have to better better than Dad " has made some of Bush's world rather dull . Still the film is important . It's the first film that I've run across , be it documentary or drama that has tried to get inside the head of Bush with out demonizing him , claiming mental illness or unmitigated genius . Here is Bush the man , warts and all . It is a painful reminder that we are all fallible . I'm not sure where the film will fare a few years down the road , but I do think it is a film that deserves to be seen in it entirety and seen by everyone interested in where we've been and where we're headed .
498303	1355507	90328	7.0	I rather liked it .	Hammer House of Horror : Witching Time is set in rural England on Woodstock farm where stressed musician David Winter ( Jon Finch ) lives with his actress wife Mary ( Prunella Gee ) & is currently composing the music for a horror film . One night while looking for his dog Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn , calling herself Lucinda Jessop ( Patricia Quinn ) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now . Obviously rather sceptical David has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor Charles ( Ian McCulloch ) to come examine her , however once he arrives & they enter the room Lucinda has disappeared . Charles puts it down to David drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to David & Mary . . . Witching Time was episode 1 from the short lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer studios for TV & originally aired here in the UK during September 1980 , the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver ( episode 13 The Mark of Satan being the other ) I actually rather liked this . As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly Watching Time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch , the script by Anthony Read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace . The character's are pretty good as is the dialogue , there are some nice scenes here & I liked the way it never quite reveals whether David & Mary are going crazy or not . I think it's a well structured , entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would . Being made for British TV meant the boys at Hammer had a lower budget than usual , if that was even possible , & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know Frankenstein & Dracula films although the contemporary English setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more . Another TV based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for , there's some nudity & gore but not much although I didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good . It's well made for what it is & Hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good , the acting is good as well with genre favourite Ian McCulloch making a bit-part appearance . Witching Time is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series , as a 50 minute piece of British TV it's pretty damned good , now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore ?
543728	562732	427132	10.0	Incredible trip back .	Having recently seen Romero's new Land of the Dead I decided to go back and check out some of the extra features included on the massive Ultimate DVD collection of Dawn of the Dead , which I didn't like . I remember being amazed at the sickness of Dawn of the Dead , which I consider to be by far the goriest of the trilogy . I remember being hugely unimpressed by the 1978 version of Dawn of the Dead ( and surprisingly impressed by the 2004 remake ) , so it was great to see the cast and crew talking about making the movie in this wonderful documentary . One of my favorite individual moments in this documentary was when Tom Savini talked about how he had planned to put make-up on all of the zombies to make them look gray but that it turned out to be a bad idea because they came out so many different colors ? green , blue , etc , and just didn't look right . This was , if I remember correctly , one of the things that most bothered me about the 1978 Dawn because , being the first film in the trilogy to be filmed in color , the ineffective make-up was a big problem for me . For a movie that was made nearly three decades ago , I was really surprised at how much detail they were able to get into this documentary , as well as how many of the original cast , many of them almost obscure zombies from the film , they were able to get together for interviews to talk about their experiences in making the movie . It was great to see how the town of Pittsburgh really came together to help make the movie , having been so impressed by the original film , and how much of a fun fiasco the making of the movie was for so many of the extras and for the cast . This entire DVD collection is a wonderful compilation of information about the making of the movie and the movie itself , and even if you didn't love the film itself , as I didn't , this is definitely something to check out . I have often noticed that documentaries and other supplemental materials included with DVDs can vastly improve your opinion of a movie , and this one is no exception . Don't miss this one .

442473	819382	804461	2.0	There is Nothing New Under the Gun .	I guess someone reckoned it was time to resuscitate the " Death Wish " movies that began in 1974 , but the similarly title " Death Sentence " had to be updated , and for good reason . This is not the late 60s or early 70s when urban crime rates were triple what they'd been just a few years earlier . The dangers of urban life were very real . Statistics don't begin to tell the story . In the neighborhood I lived in , adjacent to the University of Pennsylvania , every Mom and Pop store , every shop , had been held up at least once , with the owners " looking down the barrel of a shotgun , " as one tough old lady put it . The deli owner kept a loaded gun under the counter . The liquor store would periodically acquire one or two bullet holes through its plate glass window . I knew girls who had been raped twice on campus . I was burglarized three times . Every building was decorated with graffiti . Now THAT is a crime wave that Charles Bronson could fight . The muggers and vandals and robbers were anonymous . The threat lay over the city air like an acrid odor . But the young men responsible for that disorganization were baby boomers in their prime . They're now in their 50s and 60s , so things have quieted down . Donc , the writers must now make the story personal . The son of an executive , Kevin Bacon , is killed in a gas station robbery by one of those integrated gangs one so seldom finds in real life . Pursuing a lead he sniffs out , Bacon confronts one of the gang , who is accidentally killed . Seeking revenge , the half dozen other goons ( all Goth skinheads dressed in black and sporting tattoos of barbed wire on their faces ) make several attempts on Bacon's life and finally wound him , kill his wife and shoot their other son . Bacon stumbles out of the hospital and buys four guns from an illegal dealer . There is a final shoot out between Bacon and the gang in an abandoned hospital or something . Guess who is the lone survivor . Kevin Bacon is a far more versatile actor than Charles Bronson was but it doesn't make any difference here . I couldn't identify all the ripoffs that made up this thing of shreds and patches . In addition to " Death Wish " , there's " Dirty Harry , " of course . Bacon buys a huge , stone-heavy magnum . " Guaranteed head remover , " comments the dealer . The climax is almost , but not quite , a shot-for-shot remake of " Taxi Driver " . Bacon is even wounded in the neck from behind . The gun-buying episode is ripped off from the same source - - Bacon fondles the guns and practices with them like Robert DeNiro - - but without the style or the wit . Implausibilities abound . The white-collar executive deliberately attacks and takes out an armed and brawny skinhead , beating the crap out of him and finally killing him . One of the gang marches into Bacon's office and thrusts a package into his hands , snarling , " This is to let you know that you won't die alone . " Bacon stares at the rudely wrapped box for a moment , then sets it on his desk and proceeds to open it . Would you do that ? It's a brutal movie and its ugliness is enhanced by the photography , which uses techniques I don't have the vocabulary to describe . All the images are tinted , mostly a ghoulish green , like a garter snake's belly . Some are blood red . The images are sharply defined so that we can easily make out every whisker stippling a man's chin , every bead of sweat during tense moments . A wide angle lends is used for some close ups , turning the face into that of a malign dolphin . Gun freaks should love it , and so should kids of about , oh , say fourteen , plagued by high testosterone levels . Maybe there are a lot of them around because the user rating is pretty high . If there is a market demand , we should prepare ourselves for " Death Sentence II " and all the rest of the crap that degrades our screens these days .
492501	3280905	50825	10.0	The Mutinies of 1917 - a fictional variant	Although he did the wonderful crime film THE KILLING before he did this , it was PATHS OF GLORY that brought Stanley Kubrick's talents forward . After PATHS OF GLORY he would make all types of films , but he would basically make them as he wanted to ( although when working with his star here , Kirk Douglas , on SPARTACUS he would have such friction with Douglas that they never made any other films together afterward ) . So if it had not been for PATHS OF GLORY there would not have been LOLITA , DR . STRANGELOVE , 2001 , BARRY LYNDON , and the other films . The Kubrick stamp of film artistry was born here . The plot of the story is simple . Due to the system of trenches on the Western Front ( that have France and Britain on one side and Germany on the other ) the war has bogged down to a mutual bloodletting . It shouldn't been this way , but nobody that was sent to the Western Front through 1917 was a good commander . Von Falkenheyn , the German Commander at Verdun , was unable to hold onto early gains in that long , long battle . The best French General was Joseph Gallieni , who won the First Battle of the Marne by commissioning the famous " taxicab " army that drove the French troops to the front . But he retired . The actual Commander , " Papa " Joffre was popular with the men , but had a tendency of falling asleep at military strategy sessions . As for the British , Douglas Haig was saddled with planning global strategy for British forces in Africa , the Middle East , and India . His acceptance of the stalemate on the Western Front bordered on the criminal - he reduced the monstrous casualty rate to a simple war of attrition . With Commanders like Von Falkenheyn , Haig , and Joffre the war was hopeless . The suggestion of one more push " over the top " was repeated endlessly - and bloodily . In 1917 units of the French Army had enough . The French Mutinies were long known , because of the trials and executions of hundreds of mutineers . One good result was the arrival at headquarters of General Henri Petain . His reputation is besmirched by his treason in leading the Vichy Government in World War II , but Petain was a senile old man when made a figure-head ( a fact his old friend General Charles DeGaulle knew , so that he reduced the death sentence against the old man to life imprisonment ) . One generation earlier , Petain saved the army and France - a debt that really should not be forgotten . Yes he tried the ringleaders , but he also improved the lot of the poilu ( common soldiers ) so that they were not living like moles or rats all the time . The regeneration of the French armies that Ferdinand Foch would lead ( with Haig and Pershing and their men ) to eventual victory began when Petain took charge . SPOILERS AHEAD : PATHS OF GLORY looks at the situation that led to those mutinies , and to one of the drumhead courts . Adolph Menjou is a leading general , who realizes that a victory is required for appearance sake ( i . e . , the politicians are breathing down the back of the French High Command ) . He invites his old friend George Macready to lunch and drops a hint that if they could find a nice victory Macready may get promoted ( Menjou says this very carefully - no fool he if he has to deny it ) . Macready can just taste the promotion . He promises the men will do the job . They don't . The job is to capture a well protected salient called " the ant hill " , because whenever men are fighting over it they look like ants fighting each other from a distance . The leader of the men who are to charge is Kirk Douglas . In peacetime he is an attorney , so he has enough brains to question the intelligence of the so-called army brains . Macready is watching the attack from a bomb shelter , and notices the men will not leave the trench . He orders an artillery barrage on his own men , forcing them to face the Germans . This will turn out to be a disastrous mistake on his part . After the disaster Macready picks three soldiers to be representative of the troops . One of them is selected by a Sergeant who is a real coward , and who is aware the enlisted man knows he is a coward . Douglas defends them , but the court is controlled by Macready and his flacks . The three are convicted . We watch their last night , with one ( Timothy Carey ) certain that a pardon will come for him at least . Another gets badly injured in a mishap . When the time for the three to be shot occurs ( they are set up like Christ and the two robbers at Calvary ) , the wounded man is slapped out of unconsciousness to see the firing squad getting ready to fire . Douglas has been discovering what Macready did - and reveals this to Menjou . He hopes to do this to force Menjou to overturn the death sentences . But Menjou holds back , and lets the executions go on . We see him dancing at a dinner party while this is going on . The next day , when Macready is having breakfast with Menjou ( and Douglas shows up ) , Menjou brings up the illegal act of firing on his own men . Instead of a promotion , Macready is being thrown out of his command , and probably prevented from getting further ones . Pulling his shredded dignity together as best he could , he pointedly states that at least he was a soldier ( unlike the courtier - general Menjou ) . After he leaves , Menjou offers Macready's command to Douglas . And Douglas tells him off very memorably . PATHS OF GLORY is a fantastically good look at military incompetence , corruption , and those shafts of decency that the common soldiers and Douglas represent . Although set in time and place in 1917 France , it's message is universal . It is a great movie .
512867	3223254	469071	10.0	An Extraordinary Mastering of a Challenge	Thom Harp is a major talent . Not only did he ( and his excellent crew ) meet the demanding standards of this entry into Seattle International Film Festival's Fly Film-making Challenge 2005 , Harp surpassed this test and created a short film that is better realized than many a full length feature film on the big screens at present . Just as short stories are more tough to pull off than novels , short films carry the same burden - create a storyline that is immediately involving and interesting , keep an eye on the arc of the tale , and finish it off with enough aplomb to catch the viewer by happy surprise . Kate ( a very talented and camera-loved Jessica Skerritt ) is at wit's end to secure a relationship with her off-to-college boyfriend and with the help of her ' co-horts ' she decides to drive to the big city to be with him . Problem : Kate can't drive ! Having failed her driving test X4 , she engages a Safe-T Drivers instructor Mr . Meeker ( a wonderfully subtle Tony Doupé ) and proceeds to chatter away with the near-terrorized Meeker to the point of mishap . Yet despite her roller-coaster test drive , Kate is so committed to her obsession that Meeker assures her she WILL succeed . . . And so comes the resolution of the outing - with a huge dose of irony , comedy , and timing that makes this little film sparkle . Co-written with Mike Standish , Harp achieves sharply drawn characters in a very limited time , characters about whom we care and whose comments , especially from minor characters Doug ( Vincent Scott ) and Kurt ( Kaelon Horst ) , linger in that corner of the brain that traps good humor for later digestion . His direction is imaginative , creative , and solid , drawing a true ensemble result from his winning cast . A Terrific Aperitif - leaving us with hopes for a full-fledged feature !
469540	1532177	284837	6.0	Better Than Socks	I used to love Sacha Baron Cohen's creation of Ali G on THE 11 0'CLOCK SHOW in the late 90s . I also liked the spin off show though it should be pointed out by then the joke was wearing thin and it was obvious his guests were in on the joke of having a white boy impersonating a black ghetto boy wannabe . When ALI G INDAHOUSE was released I didn't bother to see it because Ali was probably past his sell by date then . But my brother bought me the video of this film and watched it on Boxing day and I must confess it was a lot better than I expected ALI G INDAHOUSE is a very funny if you understand the " Wigger " culture of middle class white boys wishing they were black . I was laughing out loud at the first half of the film as Ali lays down the facts to his posse that wearing the wrong colours in the ghetto could cost you your life , and Ali on the election trail had me in absolute stitches as he drove down Staines high street giving a rap broadcast , but then the film goes slightly downhill as an extremely unlikely political plot takes shape and the jokes slow down So all in all ALI G INDAHOUSE is funny but slightly uneven . I still watch the video a couple of months after getting it but only the first half . It's a lot better than getting socks for Christmas so thanks for the video Neill
409110	2567136	402141	8.0	Reel Or Imaginary	This is yet another valentine to movies and the part they play in people's lives , at once referential and innovative . It does however require a certain suspension of disbelief - is it , for example , feasible that a caretaker would ( a ) be allowed to live in the museum full time and ( b ) have access to all the expensive equipment housed there so that he can , in effect , run movies to his heart's content . Once we get round that we can relax and enjoy what is in effect a gentle , tender romance in which people get beaten up ; it's contraries like this that make it interesting . Essentially it's a film about losers , four to be exact : A girl who works in a fast-food outlet with only vague dreams of improving her lot ; her boyfriend who steals cars for a living and treats her as an object rather than a partner , yet , perversely doesn't want to lose her but will if the right man comes along ; her roommate , a hairdresser , who fancies the car thief herself , and Martino , the caretaker of the museum , who lives in a world of his own and takes as a role model Buster Keaton . Martino loves the girl from afar but when she scalds her boss and the police are called she holes up in the museum and falls into a relationship with Martino . When the heat is off and she can leave she realizes that she loves both men , who ask her to choose between them . This is a quirky entry that definitely grows on you and benefits by featuring virtual unknowns in the lead roles . Well worth checking out and very probably a second look .
407815	865972	422272	9.0	Creepy and sad .	Mercy Falls Children's Hospital on the Isle of Wight is about to close down for good . With a train crash filling up the intended transfer hospital , the remaining eight children and skeleton staff are forced to wait for a few days before they can leave . Barely holding on to her self-control following an earlier , devastating case of alleged negligence , night shift nurse Calista Flockhart is alarmed by an unusual number of cases involving broken bones among the children . The kids themselves talk ominously of a " mechanical girl " on the abandoned , apparently haunted second floor . " Fragile " is another creepy horror winner from Jaume Balaguero of " Darkness " and " The Nameless " fame . It relies on uneasy atmosphere of dread instead of gore and shocks . Lingering shots of darkened , empty corridors and carefully timed moments of genuine alarm totally creeped me out . Give this eerie and depressing gem a look .
538462	3717154	164212	7.0	do whatever it is morons do . . . .	While San Juan celebrates San Sebastian's Feast , recently-divorced and world-weary police captain Victor Benezet calls in prominent attorney Henry Hearst to clarify his statement about discovering the body of a girl of about 12 , the second such murder in two weeks . As Hearst answers unconvincingly , Benezet reveals circumstantial evidence : the lawyer is under suspicion . The interrogation strips away Hearst's dignity , public persona , and even his toupee , exposing a breech with his beautiful and much younger wife , questionable sexual predilections and a damning hobby . Then , Hearst's wife volunteers information that confirms police suspicions . Is Hearst finally at the breaking point ? . . . . as intriguing as the movie is , it's the ending that really suffers with problems . the main problem being that it doesn't know how to end , so from an amazing 110 minutes of vocal fisticuffs from the two leads , we are basically given a nonsense ending , which i guess Hopkins would have hoped would have the audience debating and so on . the main question i was asking at the end of the film was , why ? and what was the whole point ? obviously people are going to have their own opinions of Hearsts reason , as i do myself , but a lot of people may feel a little cheated as the film does lead the audience up the ' big revelation ' path , only for them to hit a brick wall . but the film is great to watch and offers red herrings galore . Jane in particular was a very suspicious character , and threw me off the films trail at times , but the film is a lesson in acting masterclass whenever hackman and Freeman share the screen . a genius part of film making is putting all the characters into Hearsts recollections , as i feel this would have been a rather redundant production if it was in one setting . Maybe Hearst was taking his power and seeing how far it would take him , or maybe he wanted to set his wife free , the explanation is never revealed , but if you are a fan of the two leads , this will suffice .
584596	1219578	242998	3.0	my bloody valentine	The huge success of " Scream " in 1996 enabled to launch a new trend in the horror movie . This trend is based on a so-far peaceful universe but destroyed by the arrival of a disruptive element which is epitomized by a serial-killer . I would also add that since " Scream " and another " I know what you did last summer " , anything goes to shot horror movies whose topic deals with a serial-killer . Here , Saint Valentine's day is used as a pretext to shot a new opus with the quoted topic . The result gives a movie that barely shines by the originality of the directing , the paucity of the script , the impression of " déjà-vu " in several moments ( murders ) . " Valentine " brings nothing new to an already threadbare topic . You may skip this movie without remorse .
484083	1416505	407887	9.0	This is the Martin Scorsese I missed for such a long time .	Let's face it , Martin Scorsese has made some good movies the past few years but nothing too brilliant or remarkable , at least not compared to his more early work from the ' 70's , ' 80's and early ' 90's . The last real brilliant Scorsese was in my opinion the remake " Cape Fear " , which dates back from 1991 . But " The Departed " is really again a movie that deserves to be on the long list of brilliant Martin Scorsese movies . From the opening sequence on it's obvious ; this is a typical Scorsese movie . For this movie he went back to the genre were he already was successful with in the past ; the gangster-movies . It's a nice touch for a change that the movie is set in present time . After all , why should the best gangster-movies always take place in the past ? " The Departed " is a greatly told and constructed modern crime movie about an infiltrator in the state police and an infiltrator in a crime syndicate who have to hunt each other down . It's a movie that provides the movie with some thrills , unexpected twists ( especially toward the ending ) and some great confrontations between different characters . The story on its self is already quite good ( Just loose the love-story next times . It adds nothing to the characters or story . ) and interesting but it's made all the more great by the way it is told . Not only kudos to Scorsese's directing for that but also most definitely for the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker , with lots of good quick flash-forwards and other tricks . All I can say is that she really deserved her Oscar for this movie . It really helps to tell the story and give the movie a look and identity of its own . The movie its cast doesn't seem like the most likely won but it works out perfect in the movie . I think a lot of people were screaming for Robert De Niro but also Jack Nicholson is perfectly believable and just great as a gangster-boss . Mark Wahlberg was great as a bastard-cop and Alec Baldwin as a nice cop . The other way around would seem more logical but they work out surprisingly well in their roles . It was good to see Matt Damon in a more villainous and tougher role for a change , mostly because it shows how great as an actor he actually is . Leonardo DiCaprio also shows once more that he is more than just another pretty face . It's not a movie that relies on its action but more on its characters and story . The movie is exciting , tense and spectacular regardless of that it hasn't a lot of action in it . Of course this isn't Scorsese's best ( which really says something about the extremely high qualities of this man ) , so is it fair that he finally won his Oscar for this movie ? I mean after all , if this movie won , then should had movies such as " Heat " , " Training Day " and so on . As a matter of fact it is of course true that if this movie was completely the same but had another director's name attached to it this movie would probably not had been nominated at all . It's just not the Oscar-type of movie but alas , I'm glad that Scorsese finally has an Oscar now , only just 3 decades too late .

513530	3223254	449059	10.0	' Being a Winner is only a state of mind '	and being a winner of a film based on so many potentially disastrous bits of black comedy works exceedingly well ! As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past ( Borat , American Pie , Waiting , the National Lampoon endless series , etc ) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad , right and wrong , ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh - at times embarrassed , at times just having fun ! Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this odd little story of a family in Albuquerque , NM , a family comprised of a grandfather ( Alan Arkin ) whose ' elderly status ' allows him to speak inappropriately grossly and frankly to his grandchildren while snorting coke in the bathroom ; a father ( Greg Kinnear , who just gets better and better ) with a motivational program scheme that is melting toward failure ; a mother ( the extraordinary Toni Collette ) who attempts to cope with her role as the matriarch of this weird group ; the mother's brother ( Steve Carell ) , a gay Proustian scholar who has just lost his job over an affair with a grad student and has survived an unsuccessful suicide attempt ; a space-cadet teenage son ( Paul Dano ) who is in a vow of silence as he pursues Nietzsche and extracting promises for his future from his intimidated parents ; and last , but most important , a chubby little sister Olive ( Abigail Breslin ) who dotes on Miss America pageant reruns on TV and longs to tryout for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty / talent show for little girls in Southern California . The bulk of the film is a road trip which confines this very strange family in an RUV headed for the only bit of positive hope for change in Olive's ploy to become Little Miss Sunshine . Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there . Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve . The film accomplishes what comedy sets as a goal : it entertains us while allowing us to take a second look at our own foibles , and that makes for a fun and healthy outing . Highly recommended .

384753	391152	24025	10.0	Grade A Entertainment ! An Underrated Gem !	Flying Down to Rio will always be best known for being the movie that first paired Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers , but , believe me , its worth goes far beyond just that stunning accomplishment . The lead actor is Gene Raymond , who was one of the funniest actors in early Hollywood . My other favorite Raymond movie is Hitchcock's only foray into straight comedy , Mr . and Mrs . Smith , where he starred opposite Carole Lombard and was more than up to it . Raymond's female opposite here is Delores de Rio , an actress with whom I am unfamiliar , but , man , is she a beauty . Astaire plays Raymond's best friend and cohort and Rogers plays a singer who tours with them . The film is wonderfully witty and actually very inventive . The editor goes a little crazy with the different types of swipes he uses throughout the film , but they're still neat . It doesn't bother me much that the filmmakers ' experiments don't always work . I'm just happy they were trying new things . The cinematography is often great and much more unique than in other RKO musicals . The music is marvelous , especially the show-stopping Carioca ( as opposed to Karaoke ! ) , which seems to last forever , but in a good way ! This is the number with the Astaire and Rogers dance . The other dancers in the scene are also wonderful , and the editing of that number is particularly amazing . The climactic musical sequence is as amazing as it is silly : seemingly hundreds of women dancing on the wings of flying planes . It's meant to be entertainment for the people below , but , well , the intricate movements of the girls could never have been seen on the ground ( reminiscent of the Busby Berkeley number in 42nd Street where the camera shoots the dancers ' pattern from above ) . Again , the editing here is simply remarkable . I can only imagine that the daring stunts perpetrated in the scene , though obviously fake , would have stunned the hell out of an audience in 1933 ! Today , in the 21st Century , Flying Down to Rio plays as one of the greatest pieces of fluff ever produced . .
520642	1162550	435705	2.0	Next time choose to watch a better movie	Nicolas Cage is Chris Johnson an average Joe who happens to have the gift of seeing two minutes into his future ( ass well as every possible deviance therein ) , when the FBI learns of his peculiar gift they ( specifically Julianne Moore's character of Callie Ferris ) want him to help with preventing an imminent terrorist attack whether he wants to or not . There's also a love interest pigeonholed into the tale in the form of Jessica Biel whom Chris can see way farther into the future when he's with . Also if you're looking for anything but an extremely loose adaptation of a PKD novel move on . As this has almost absolutely zilch to do with the book . For the most part this film was a fun , albeit absurdest , bit of escapism . You know the kind strictly popcorn-munching check your brain at the door type fare . Cage was likable as always and I somehow bought him in the role . Julianne was a bit less believable , but one could tell that she did the best with what little the script gave her . Jessica , well let's simply say Miss Biel isn't in the biz on account of her acting ability and when he looks go so does her career and leave it at that . I was into the film , yea , but then IT happened . IT being the horrible ending that simply moots everything that came before . It's an ugly cop-out that soured the whole film for me and a reason i'd likely never watch the movie again . The putrid aftertaste was so pungent that I choose to skip the extras housed on the DVD completely ( a rarity for me ) , opting instead to get it out of my DVD player and send it back to netflix with an unrivaled quickness .
384731	391152	20620	6.0	Yes , it is bad , but . . .	I think it qualifies as a must-see film for all true scholars of the cinema . That is not to say that it is a good film . It is most certainly not . But this is really a perfect film in which to study the biggest change that this artistic medium ever experienced , the change from silence to sound . The whole film comes off as so , so awkward . It doesn't help that the script is awful . The film is actually over-ambitious , trying hard to cover the entire life of Abe , from birth to death . However bad Abraham Lincoln is , though , I myself found it more than watchable and always fascinating . .
422345	2248099	96098	7.0	Very good eighties cop thriller	Deadly Pursuit certainly has it's fair share of problems , but as an entertaining little action thriller ; it stands up well to criticism , as while some of the dialogue , situations and character drawings don't exactly ring true ; the film moves quickly and director Roger Spottiswoode does a good job of ensuring that the film is easy viewing and never becomes boring . Deadly Pursuit is something of a film of two halves ; it starts off as a gritty cop thriller , and then mutates into a survivalist themed chase movie . The plot is fairly standard at first , as we witness a man being caught robbing a diamond store . The plot thickens when , after some interrogation from the arresting officers , it turns out that the thief actually owns the store ! We then learn that he's stealing the diamonds to pay a kidnapper for the release of his wife . FBI agent Warren Stantin manages to chase the kidnapper down , but he gets away with the diamonds and flees into a forest near Canada ; thus meaning that Agent Stantin must chase the killer into the woods , with the help of a rugged local who knows the area . The film does have a number of problems - sometimes , for example , it seems to just jump from one scene to the next without much in the way of a connection . This does keep things moving , but the film can feel a bit disjointed because of it . Still , the plot flows fairly well and enough different angles are created to keep things interesting . The film features a decent cast , headed up by Sidney Poitier . Poitier's character changes a lot through the film , and while the actor sometimes looks a bit silly , he does seem to manage this well . He is joined by Tom Berenger , who also gives a decent performance in his role , while the rest of the cast is filled out by the likes of Clancy Brown , Kirstie Alley and Andrew Robinson . Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the fact that we don't know who the killer is for so long , which builds suspense - and mystery , and the film also carries off a nice twist little twist with the choice of actors surrounding the killer . Overall , I can't really say that Deadly Pursuit is one of the best films of its type - but it's certainly a very good thriller and I recommend watching it !
409624	2567136	44446	8.0	The Sound And The Glory	It's a fact universally acknowledge that some writers work better with some directors than others and vice versa . Working separately director Marcel Carne made one great film ( Hotel du Nord ) , several decent films ( Therese Raquin , Julia ou le cle des songes ) and several ho-hum entries ; also working separately Jacques Prevert fared slightly better writing Le Crime de Monsieur Lange , Les Amants de Verone , Voyage Surprise , Un oiseau rare among other but TOGETHER they made seven of the most distinguished movies in French cinema and if you want me to list them you clearly stepped in here to get out of the rain , the Multiplex is three blocks down . Terry Rattigan worked best with Puffin Asquith and David Lean with Noel Coward yet here we have Lean directing a Rattigan screenplay . You can see Lean's thinking ; he didn't want to go through life riding on the coat-tails of Coward , what Rattigan didn't know about constructing a play could fit in an eye-dropper and still leave room for an eight-to-one martini , he'd served in the RAF during the war and had written one of the two finest British war films actually produced during the war , The Way To The Stars - the other was In Which We Serve , written , produced , starring and co-directed by Coward with Lean . On paper this was great , get some stats about supersonic flight , turn them over to Terry and let him flesh them out and humanise them . Mostly it's good but it COULD have been great - think Sinatra and Lawrence Welk ; put these two together and you'll get an album that neither has to be ashamed of but team Sinatra with Billy May , Gordon Jenkins , Nelson Riddle and we're talking Hall of Fame . So : We have a lyrical opening sequence in which a plane is ' stooging ' about over the channel with the cliffs of Dover prominent ; there's a carefree , buoyant , waltz-time feel that sets us up for the revelation that this is wartime . Pilot John Justin goes into a dive and when the plane begins to shudder he finds it difficult to throttle back , an experience he discusses with chum Nigel Patrick back on the aerodrome ; Patrick , however , is in love and not interested but the object of his affection , Ann Todd , just happens to be the daughter of a leading aircraft manufacturer , Ralph Richardson , who offers Patrick a job as test pilot after the war . Rattigan gets this over economically so that we can cut to the chase , which , in this case , is the quest for fire i . e . designing and building a plane capable of supersonic flight . In only his second film Denholm Elliott unveils the prototype for his series of weak , callow youths , in the role of Todd's kid brother who funks his first solo and winds up on the menu . Leslie Phillips , sans moustache gets twice as much screen-time as Elliott but is totally forgettable leaving the real acting to the big boys . Nigel Patrick had just come off Rattigan's The Browning Version - with Puffin Asquith at the helm - and played essentially the same role if schoolteachers were piloting jet planes or pilots were flying desks . Nigel Patrick was one of the old school stage actors , shoot cuffs first , ask anyone for tennis later and enhanced virtually every film in which he played . This is a film you want to like and mostly do if only . . .

491657	3280905	39589	8.0	Lucy Trying to Find a Killer	For some reason LURED has not shown up on television very often . I don't know why , as it is well acted and directed . Possibly because of a flaw in the 1947 telling of the story that would be handled differently today . The villain is killing women because he cannot attract them like other men , and sees that they are at their most beautiful when they are dead ( which oddly enough would have been the viewpoint of Reginald Christie , the Rillington Place strangler who was alive in 1947 and killing ) . But today the character would probably be latently homosexual . There are signs of it in his intellectual interests and even his use of poetry , as opposed to the other males in the film ( especially the hero ) . I think that might have made the film a trifle more believable . LURED is based on a 1939 French movie that starred Maurice Chevalier , and possibly gave that great entertainer his meatiest dramatic role . The cast here is damned good one , with Lucille Ball as an American dancer in London who is searching for a missing friend . She is recruited by Charles Coburn ( as a Chief Inspector from Scotland Yard ) to assist him , Alan Napier , and Robert Coote in trying to find her friend and solve the disappearance ( in two years ) of eight other woman . She is supposed to be bait for the criminal - to lure him into a trap . Lucy is given the personal columns and is to answer all that pertain to some man seeking a woman as a companion . Ball is good - first as a tired American down on her luck ( she is now a taxi dancer ) . She is hard boiled , but she seeks to improve herself . She does get a chance by answering an invitation to work for a nightclub owned by George Sanders and Cedric Hardwicke . But then her friend vanishes , and she finds her sense of public duty overcoming ambition . Except for one thing . Fate keeps throwing her and Sanders together , and the latter ( from his phone call with Lucy earlier ) has been very interested in her . Slowly they are falling in love . But she is determined to help Coburn . And the screenplay allows Douglas Sirk to go to town here . Sirk was brilliant at using the riches of materialism to manipulate his audiences ( best shown in the 1950s in his color films ) . But in black and white he is just as effective , illustrating the situations Lucy finds herself in by his use of sets and costumes . First the meets Boris Karloff , a well dressed man who seems to be offering her a modeling job . He is . But ( in a switch for Karloff ) he is an insane couturier ( ruined years earlier by unscrupulous competitors ) , and he is putting on his greatest show ( with Lucy wearing a twenty year old ( 1920 style ) gown for a non-existent audience of blue-bloods ( the main seat supposedly for a Princess has a British bull dog growling in it ! ) . Next she answers an ad for a maid in a banker's house . Interestingly this involves Lucy with a gang run by Joseph Calleia and Alan Mowbray ( as a crooked butler - Topper's butler would not have approved ) . The gang is also causing young women to vanish , but for commercial reasons . Again the script is forced to change what is probably going on : the women , in the finished film are being shipped to become thieves working for Calliea in South America . In reality they would probably be turned into prostitutes in a white slavery ring down there . Again Sirk manages to translate a vision of the danger Lucy is in by the claustrophobic lower kitchen of the house where she is alone with a suspicious Calleia and a dumbfounded Mowbray . Finally Lucy agrees to marry George , and everything seems headed smoothly ahead , except for the mysterious criminal sending another poem to the Yard that seems to aim at Lucy . Then she finds disturbing items in Sanders ' desk . And the story takes us back to the serious elements we saw earlier when Lucy was trying to find her missing pal . The film is quite good , and bears good comparison to later Sirk masterpieces like MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION and IMITATION OF LIFE . I only wish to add what several have pointed out : the performance of George Zucco as a Scotland Yard Lieutenant who works with Lucy , and is brave , but is also a perfect comic partner for her . Watch his interest in crosswords , and how she unconsciously helps him on them .
419276	1609079	21357	7.0	Diabetes alert !	" Seven Days ' Leave " is based on James M Barrie's play ' The Old Lady Shows Her Medals ' . The title change is interesting , as it moves the play's emphasis from the old-lady character ( Sarah Ann Dowey ) to the soldier ( Private Dowey ) who visits her on his furlough from the trenches . The soldier is played ( very well ) by Gary Cooper , and the original advertising campaign for this film made it clear that ' Coop ' was the star of this movie , with the old lady firmly a supporting role . But in fact Sarah Dowey is still the central character in this maudlin drama , even though the screenplay builds up Private Dowey's character . I viewed this film in 1992 through the kind assistance of film scholar William K Everson , who had a restored print in his collection . Mr Everson and I both had some trepidation in watching this film , as the central character of Mrs Dowey is played by Beryl Mercer , whom William Everson and I agreed is the single most annoying performer in the entire history of motion pictures . Mercer specialised in maudlin tear-stained performances , all trembling and whines and heaving bosoms . The fact that " Seven Days ' Leave " has a maudlin plot line in its own right seemed to threaten that Mercer's performance would be even more bathetic than usual . James M Barrie's plot lines veered towards the diabetic , and this one is no exception . But I was curious to see Gary Cooper's performance . As Mr Everson himself had not viewed this film in more than 20 years , our mutual curiosity won out . " Seven Days ' Leave " turns out to be better than I'd thought . Cooper gives an impressive performance , and Mercer's maudlin moaning is less obtrusive than I had feared , due to the fact that this story has some legitimate tear-jerking to do . SYNOPSIS CONTAINS SPOILERS . Sarah Ann Dowey ( Mercer ) is an elderly charwoman in London during the Great War . She cries herself ' Mrs ' Dowey , but in fact she never married and is childless . ( Apparently an elderly widow commanded more respect in 1914 than an elderly spinster . ) The other three scrubwomen who char with Mrs Dowey - Mesdames Mickelham , Haggerty and Twymley - all have sons in uniform , and Mrs Dowey feels left out . . . until she spots a newspaper despatch mentioning Private Kenneth Dowey of the Canadian Black Watch . ( In the original play , the soldier was Scottish : here he's been made Canadian so that Gary Cooper won't have to attempt a Scottish accent . ) Mrs Dowey tells her neighbours and co-workers that this soldier is her son . She then proceeds to send him letters and cakes , which she claims are from ' Lady Dolly Kanister ' , apparently a genuine person . ( I guarantee that no peeress was ever named Dolly , much less Kanister . ) She reads to the other charwomen extracts from ' letters ' she receives from her ' son ' ; these are really blank paper . The well-meaning Reverend Willings , believing that Pvt Dowey is genuinely Mrs Dowey's son , arranges for them to meet . Private Dowey ( Cooper ) is astonished to learn that this scrubwoman is his ' Lady Dolly ' benefactress . There is a genuinely touching scene in which Dowey tells her that he is an orphan , while Mrs Dowey excitedly recalls her ' memories ' of young Kenneth's boyhood . These ' memories ' are all her own invention , yet she has genuinely persuaded herself that this handsome soldier is her son whom she has raised from birth , and that these memories are real . Like Martha in ' Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? ' , Mrs Dowey has given herself a pathetic fantasy of motherhood , and now she inhabits it so fully that she believes it is real . This screenplay opens up the original play considerably , as Private Dowey now takes his ' mother ' to the theatre and to a restaurant , where they sup champagne . ( He must be getting a general's wages . ) By the time his leave is up , these two people have touchingly accepted each other as mother and son . Private Dowey returns to the front , where he soon volunteers for a mission to eliminate a German machine-gun nest . He dies a hero . . . and his posthumous medal is given to his mother , Sarah Ann Dowey . " Seven Days ' Leave " could have become dangerously bathetic , yet it works much better than I had expected , and this is largely down to Gary Cooper's splendid performance . The screenplay dilutes much of James M Barrie's twee-ness , and I expect that cynical John Farrow deserves the credit for this . Beryl Mercer gives ( by her standards ) a surprisingly restrained performance ; the very underrated director Richard Wallace deserves praise for this . Daisy Belmore is quite good as one of Mercer's sister charwomen . I was expecting " Seven Days ' Leave " to be a wallow in treacle , but it's far less cloying than I'd expected . I'll rate this movie , mostly for Cooper's performance , Wallace's directing , and the screenplay .
449939	2093818	245943	5.0	A decent spoof of The Blair Witch Project	When reviewing this film , it's hard not to be at least a little biased ; there are people who love some of the hip-hop / rap artists in this film , and hate the rest , there are some who hate all of them ( and the entire rap music genre ) , and then there are the few who love all of them ( I guess , though I've never met anyone who loved all of them , especially since many of them hate each other ) . Let me say right now : I hate Vanilla Ice and Ja Rule , I have an enormous amount of respect and love for Eminem and his music , and most of the rest of these artists I am indifferent to ( several of them I don't even know ) . I did indeed want to see this film because I knew Eminem was in it , though not as much for his talent or my being a fan of his , as simply the fact that I knew that he can be incredibly funny , as I've seen a lot of interviews with him , and he also played a great funny character in The Wash with Dr . Dre and Snoop Dogg . And let me tell you right away , if you like Eminem's warped , funny sense of humor that we often see in interviews , you will like his performance in this film . He can really convince you that he believes what he's saying is true , no matter how bizarre it sounds . Many of the other rappers give half-decent witness statements , though a few were very bad and just took up screen time . Worst was probably Ja Rule and Vanilla Ice , in my opinion , but then again , that might just be because I hate them . The " main characters " of the film have unbelievably little screen time , actually , and are probably only there to make fun of the original group of morons from the original Blair Witch film . They only have one really funny scene , and then a scene at the end that obviously makes fun of a similar scene in the original Blair Witch , and apart from those two , I'd guess they have two or three other scenes , that might have one or two good jokes in total , while the rest , like several other things in this film , merely take up screen time . What's funny about this film is , even though there seemed to be so many low points and pointless scenes , I never really felt like turning it off , or leaving the room to do something more fulfilling , like I seriously considered with the original Blair Witch film . Maybe it was just to see the next hilarious Eminem sequence , but something definitely kept me glued to my seat throughout the entire runtime . A lot of the jokes in the film are based on what the viewer knows about hip-hop and ghettos , not to mention black slang , which definitely limits the audience of the film , though I would say that the title can't throw too many people off . This is a spoof of The Blair Witch Project , that revolves around various hip-hop stars . The plot is fairly incoherent and all over the place , though I think that's the point . Don't expect some huge plot twist or to be told a great story . It's basically some hip-hop artists making fun of the basic premise of the film , a witch hunting hip-hop artists . The acting is hard to comment on , I wonder if it's supposed to look as lame and bad as it does , which I'm pretty sure that it is . The characters are also all over the place , with only a few of them being part of the actual story ( apart from , of course , the hip-hop artists themselves ) , and even fewer of them have enough screen time for us to actually recognize them , in the next scene they're in ( but maybe that's just me ) . All in all , a decent film if you're a fan of hip-hop and you just want to have a good laugh that's mostly on The Blair Witch Project's expense , but not something I would recommend too many people to watch , as many will hate it ( It appears that most who've seen it already do ) . I recommend it to huge fans of one or more of the hip-hop artists , or just people who'll go to great lengths to laugh at and mock The Blair Witch Project . Not something you want to spend too much money on ( I got it as a gift , thankfully ) .
363378	4888011	44706	10.0	now this is what I call a western	It has been noted many times that " High Noon " was an allegory for people refusing to stand up to the McCarthy-era blacklist . And a masterpiece at that . Happening circa 1880 , Sheriff Will Kane ( Gary Cooper ) of Hadleyville , New Mexico , has just gotten married to Quaker Amy Fowler ( Grace Kelly ) and is retiring from law enforcement . Unfortunately , he receives news that a criminal whom he sent to jail has been released and will arrive in town at noon . Kane tries to enlist help to fight the criminals , but the townspeople are too cowardly to help out , forcing Kane into the showdown of his life . The movie is a masterpiece from any angle , but the haunting theme song ( " Do Not Forsake Me , Oh My Darlin ' " ) adds to the mood . Cooper won a well deserved Oscar for his role , and this in fact was probably the best performance for all involved . Everyone should definitely see " High Noon " . It may help us one day .
496958	1355507	377749	3.0	Boring nonsense .	Dead Birds starts in the small American town of Fairhope Alabama during the year 1863 where a gang hold up the local bank , they kill a few people & steal lots of gold . As they make their escape the plan is to stay at an old farm house before moving onto Mexico , simple yet effective I'm sure you'll agree . However not everything goes according to plan & it turns out that the guy who owned the farm house a few years back was some sort of Satan worshipper , bummer eh ? It's not long before everyone starts seeing ghosts & such things . . . Directed by Alex Turner I have to say I was very unimpressed with Dead Birds so it comes as a shock that it seems to have so many positive comments written about it . The script which feels like a lame cross between Ravenous ( 1999 ) & From Dusk Till dawn ( 1996 ) by co-producer Simon Barrett takes itself very seriously & is slow , very slow & I must admit that I lose interest very quickly in slow , boring , dull & predictable films such as Dead Birds . You can easily guess what's going to happen , you know the scenario where a group of people become stuck in an isolated located through certain circumstances , they all begin to wander off on their own & get killed one-by-one . To be honest Dead Birds isn't even a decent haunted house supernatural horror , there are too many vague elements to it , the climax where everything is supposedly revealed is weak & less than shocking & the twist end made no sense to me at all . I was not impressed with any aspect of Dead Birds including that awful title which has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself as far as I could tell . Director Turner does an OK job but there's nothing spectacular on show here , the period setting is reasonably well realised but it all felt a bit sparse & low budget , just putting a candle in a room doesn't mean it looks like it belongs in the 17th century does it ? Overall the film was very unsatisfying to me , the story could have been tighter & better fleshed out & it's extremely slow . There's an OK atmosphere but I'd say it was low on scares & also lacking in decent gore . There's a bit of blood including a blown off head at the start during the robbery but afterwards it's pretty dry apart from a decapitation , some chopped up horses & something bursting out a woman's stomach . Obviously shot on a low budget Dead Birds is well made but it's hardly going to knock any houses down . The acting was alright , to be honest I can't remember anyone from it or their performances & I only saw it a few hours ago . Dead Birds is a boring , predictable & not very good low budget horror film . Amazingly it seems to have fans out there so I guess it's doing something right although to be honest I sure as hell couldn't see it . Not recommended , by me anyway .
505337	2911571	66040	8.0	good but not as shocking as it probably was in 1970	This is a strange little flick about two young girls , both from well-to-do families , who make a pact with Satan and vow to do evil . They both attend a school away from home and both are in their early teens . Now , their pact is just something they made up , and it's mostly just a game , so it seems , until they end up killing someone . A very strange and shock ending too . This was , I'm sure , a bit more a shock in the time it was released than it is now , or else I've seen too many horror movies and I'm just plain jaded . One young girl ends up being chased by a farmer's son through a cow pasture and is almost raped , until she gets away , and there's far more of her shown as she struggles to get away than would be acceptable in the US even today . There's some bird killing , fire-setting , and when both girls attempt to seduce a stranded motorist , well , things get a bit over the line , but then again , they're only in their undies , but still . This film has a rather dark feel to it most of the time and it's sort of like a twisted , perverted ABC Afterschool Special , but that feeling is probably due to the age of the protagonists . The Bad Seeds , The Good Daughters ? Hmm , well , it's certainly strange and worth checking out , .

564055	102816	96256	7.0	. . . we sleep .	Almost every John Carpenter flick is cult , or underrated , or a sleeper . It seems that audiences never truly " get " his films until long after their release . Only now are people warming slightly to Escape From L . A . They Live is no exception . It takes forever to get going and has hardly any dialogue . But remember , I'm talking from the angle of someone who lives in an era where there is always an explosion in the first ten minutes , just to interest the audience . Taken from a short story , Eight O'Clock In The Morning , the film focuses on John Nada ( Roddy Piper ) , a drifter , who comes to L . A . in search of work . After scrounging a job at a construction site , he stays in a shantytown , run by Gilbert ( Peter Jason ) , and becomes friendly with Frank ( Keith David ) . After a while , he reckons that Gilbert is up to no good , as he is always disappearing into the gospel church across the street , and is reluctant to spill the beans too easily . Nada gets the feeling that something's not quite right . And so do we . Only we can't figure out what . Then the fuzz show up and lay waste to the shantytown . Nada just stands there and watches , looking totally confused . Next day , he raids the church , only to find boxes of sunglasses . He swipes one and when he wears it , not only does he see in black-and-white , but the world isn't quite the same . Ads and billboards tell him to " Eat " , " Sleep " or " Marry And Reproduce " . Magazines say nothing but " No Independent Thought " and " Do Not Question Authority " . But , most distressingly , some humans do not look human in the least . They have big bulging eyes , with purple skull-heads . Naturally , Nada is freaked out . Everything rests on his shoulders . He hardly ever speaks , yet the story is told through his eyes . We know what he knows only by reaction and facial expression . It's a difficult role and yet Piper handles is pretty good . Although the dialogue is pure exposition , Carpenter never fully presents us , or Nada , with a threatening situation . Obviously , the non-humans are aliens . But , like the tagline says , who are they , and what do they want ? It seems like they want to rule the world and exploit the working class , but that's the way things are anyhow . Apparently , they lead ordinary lives . If they weren't around , then someone would still be running the show , probably in the exact same way . It is because of this that Nada's sudden desire to go on an alien killing spree is too much to handle . Carpenter fails to make much of the movie after this . Meg Foster's character is almost totally irrelevant and extraneous . She serves no purpose . The prolonged fight scene between Nada and Frank is supposed to be funny , but simply isn't . It just feels odd and the comedy doesn't come through . I guess Carpenter let this scene go because Piper had a lot of wrestling experience and it might be a good idea to film a less fake-looking fight with him . Although Nada and Frank are friends , the reason for them to beat the crap out of each is stupid and not ironic at all . The ending is a bit abrupt , but the director has never been one for indulgence . It's a good ending though and it will make you laugh , which is fortunate , because you're hardly likely to smile much in the second half . Interesting , but not up to the standard of Carpenter's earlier work .
564388	102816	40661	7.0	No new cats !	Jerry is tormenting Mammy-Two-Shoes ( dubbed to sound less ' offensive ' in the version that I watched and I suspect they have rewritten some of her dialogue too ) but Tom is too slow and too lazy to catch him . Annoyed with this , she introduces a new orange cat called Lightning and kicks Tom out of the house , along with Jerry , for good . But Lightning turns out to be a glutton and T & J reckon it's time they teamed up and hatch a plan to give Lightning what he deserves ( IE a painful walloping and framing him ) . Some good gags and visual humor along with a more original plot make this a better than average T & J short .
371293	2488512	264323	7.0	Dancing and Games , and Best of All , a Mouth-Watering Barbecue	While traveling on vacation to Florida , the college friends Anderson Lee ( Jay Gillespie ) , Cory Jones ( Matthe Carey ) and Nelson Elliot ( Dylan Edrington ) meet the gorgeous Joey ( Marla Leigh Malcom ) and Kat ( Gina Marie Heekin ) in a gas station traveling with their gay friend Ricky ( Brian Gross ) to the same location . Anderson gives his phone number to Joey in Florida . The teenagers decide to take a shortcut and they find a detour through an old road leading to the Southern town of Pleasant Valley . They are welcomed by the local Mayor Buckman ( Robert Englund ) as guests of honor together with Joey , Kat , Ricky and the Afro-American biker Malcolm ( Mushond Lee ) and his Chinese girlfriend Leah ( Bianca Smith ) and invited to stay for their Guts and Glory Jubilee with free lodging , meals and booze at Granny Boone's hotel , and dancing , games and a mouth-watering barbecue in the climax of the jubilee . The group accepts the invitation but sooner they find who will supply the meat for the feast . " 2001 Maniacs " is a movie with great potential of cult , having black humor , gorgeous actresses and an excellent twist in the end . I really liked this gore film a lot , and I laugh with the witty , funny and great lines , and many of them are quoted in IMDb . Robert England is amazing in the role of the revengeful southern mayor , giving a perfect touch of humor to his sadistic and friendly character . In the end , " those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it " . Title ( Brazil ) : " 2001 Maníacos " ( " 2001 Maniacs " )
452717	15896852	122690	6.0	The Poor People of Paris	The sleeve attempts to explain : " The Cold War may be over , but a new world order keeps a group of covert mercenaries - whose skills in surveillance , reconnaissance , and attack are legendary - employed by the highest bidder . These operatives for hire , known as " Ronin " , are assembled in France by a mysterious client for an extremely dangerous mission : steal a top-secret briefcase . This seemingly easy task soon proves explosive as other underworld organizations vie for the same prize . But to get the job done , this rag-tag group of misfits , led by an ex-CIA agent named Sam ( De Niro ) , must do something they've never done before - trust each other ! " Head " Ronin " ( think Japanese samurai ) Robert De Niro ( as Sam ) and Jean Reno ( as Vincent ) are definitely a team you want on your side ; the two actors have a cool chemistry , which almost makes up for the lack of an intellectually stimulating story . It can also be fun to guess where the team's traitors lurk - sometimes obvious , and sometimes not . Director John Frankenheimer and photographer Robert Fraisse provide you with wild , speeding car chases - which more than deliver orgasmic crashes . Hopefully , the citizens of Paris were advised to stay in their homes during filming . If filmmakers wanted to leave you with some mystery about the contents of a certain silver suitcase , they certainly succeeded . Probably , it was only a pair of silver ice skates . Ronin ( 1998 ) John Frankenheimer - Robert De Niro , Jean Reno , Natascha McElhone
435783	9938570	88889	5.0	Cat's Eye	So-so anthology film with a cat linking the three vignettes . The first features James Woods as the victim of an anti-smoking organization and their disturbing , unorthodox ways of " healing " their clients . The second features Robert Hays as a victim of Kenneth McMillan's nasty millionaire who " offers him a way out " from his debt to him ( Hays also was having an affair with McMillan's wife ) if he can make a complete walk around the ledges of a high-rise . Along the way , McMillan toys with him trying his best to aggravate Hays ' fall . The third , and worst , feature is about some monster in Drew Barrymore's room that sucks her life force and eats her bird . The cat plays a more major role in this particular one for it must stop the monster before it kills Drew . This film really isn't all that scary despite being set in the 80's and having Stephen King's name draped all around it . The first two vignettes have their moments ( wondering if Woods will be able to outlast his hunger to smoke or risk possible harm to his wife thanks to the evil organization's threats ; Hays ' near-falls and revenge on McMillan ) , but the third falls flat to be basking in plain silliness . The film really is only moderately successful . I did like the little in-joke with " Cujo " and getting " The Dead Zone " in there was sneaky . But , the film just doesn't have that many true thrills to ultimately satisfy the true horror fan as this film takes a more psychological approach . The satirical humor of the first film , I believe , makes it my favorite of the three .
552264	989035	183531	8.0	An eyeful ! and what eyes !	Nancy Sinatra's TV special ( originally aired on the night of Dec . 11 , 1967 ) has arrived on DVD in immaculate condition . It has built up such a mystique over the years that most people probably expect GENIUS . Well , there's a touch of genius in it . It's campy , most of all , and could benefit from better pacing , but if you love Nancy Sinatra you'll love " Movin ' With Nancy " . To review it is to review her . She wears a variety of wigs and outfits , incredible eye make-up , she shakes her groove thang with Sammy Davis , Jr . , cuddles up with father Frank ( who is delightfully loose , warm and paternal ) , and trades stiff quips with so-droll-he's-drifting-off Dean Martin . My favorite part of the show is Nancy singing " This Town " to a host of mannequins . I enjoyed " Younger Than Springtime " and the tribute to Ol Blue Eyes . The RC Cola commercials from 1967 are included as well , and are wonderful ( Nancy in the white " cell " is breathtaking - - striking poses like Mariah Carey's big sister ) . But the show just doesn't MOVE ! There's no urgency in her singing , no passion in the staging of the songs , odd and / or awkward touches and cut-aways , variety-show choreography . The songs play well on CD , but coupled with the visual , you ache for more excitement in both . It's a mixed-bag . Nancy-fanatics will just rate it a ' 10 ' and end the argument .
513462	3223254	496319	5.0	A Talky , Self-Indulgent Film Despite a Fine Cast	Ethan Hawke wrote the book THE HOTTEST STATE and then proceeded to write the screenplay , direct and act in it . Sometimes that combination works , but in this instance the whole project feels like a narcissistic self-indulgent autobiographical talky two hours . Hawke is respected enough among his peers that he was able to draw a fine cast together in an attempt to make this film work , but in the end it is pretty boring . Young Texas actor William ( Mark Webber ) has moved to New York to make it big , and while he gets jobs , he feels as though he doesn't have a handle on relationships . When he meets the beautiful singer Sarah ( Catalina Sandino Moreno ) he falls in love but has no idea how to court his dream girl . Sarah is cautious about relationships , too , yet is attracted to William and consents to travel to Mexico to heat up their bonding . In Mexico they spend the greater part of their time consummating their love affair : the love scenes are fairly erotic , especially on the part of Moreno . Returning to their jobs in New York the two face problems in continuing their relationship . William's divorced parents ( Laura Linney and Ethan Hawke ) have their own demons that prevent their providing William with much consolation , and Sarah's mother ( Sonia Braga ) has a rather negative view of relationships . How the film finally winds down with dealing with William's whining and Sarah's resistance is all that is left of the lengthy diatribe . Though Linney , Braga , Michelle Williams ( in too short a role ) , and Moreno try to make this story tolerable , it is inherent in the concept that William ( Ethan Hawke poorly disguised ) is just too boring a guy to care about . Mark Webber is supposed to have the promise and charisma of a ' new Brando ' ( according to the hype ) , but he is flat in this film . The soundtrack is wearing and rarely takes a break for the dialog . Hawke can and has done better . Hopefully he has released his ego in this film and can move on . Grady Harp
432401	2171244	454841	7.0	Now , this was interesting	The title sequence to this movie was one of the best that I have seen in years . It was fascinating and creative and it alone makes the entire movie worthwhile . The concept is also believable . I don't recall seeing something in a horror movie that I could truly believe happened . Knowing what we know now about the testing that was done with participants knowledge , we could see something like this for real . We may not , but at least it is possible and that makes the film interesting , too . Aaron Stanford took over this movie and really made it his own . He gave an outstanding performance , and I want to see more of him . Vinessa Shaw , Dan Byrd , and Emilie de Ravin also gave performances that were imminently watchable . hey , they even had Captain Leland Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine ) .
470203	1532177	114411	5.0	Drop The Pilot	Anyone remember an American sitcom called NOBODY'S PERFECT ? This starred Ron Moody as Inspector Hart of Scotland Yard ( I'm sure it was retitled HART OF THE YARD in the UK ) who's an innocent abroad when it comes to American customs and police procedures . THE SHAMROCK CONSPIRACY feels very similar in many ways to the former except it's a little more serious as it deals with terrorists , Irish ones which means we get all the old cliches like former members of the IRA on the run because they're not keen on blowing up kids ( What ! It took 25 years to realise the IRA aren't a pacifist outfit ? ) and the main bad guy being described as " An IRA extremist " as opposed to " An IRA moderate " As has been said THE SHAMROCK CONSPIRACY feels like nothing more than a TV pilot . In fact I'd go further and say that it's a TV pilot trying to cash in on the success of THE EQUALIZER with Edward Woodward more or less resurrecting his role of McCall with a few jokey bits like the scene on the NY subway thrown in . I doubt it would have lasted more than one series if it had gone into production
517685	1132073	111143	10.0	The Shadow !	Great film ! Alec Baldwin is great as the Shadow ! Jone Lone was awesome ! Penelope Ann Miller , Peter Boyle , Ian McKellen , and Tim Curry were all excellent ! Great music by Jerry Goldsmith ! I recommend that you see the Shadow !
362833	4888011	58938	10.0	Elke Sommer . . . hubba hubba	My rating of of course applies only if you're a horny teenage boy . Considering that the movie stars Elke Sommer , I probably don't need to explain the plot ( the sexual exploits of a bunch of women ) . I can also note that Virna Lisi , Monica Vitti and Gina Lollobrigida co-star , and . . . you know something ? Let me explain in the next paragraph . The skin flicks of the 1960s were cool , but what they should have done in , say , 1966 was make one big movie starring Marcello Mastroianni , Dick Van Dyke , Audrey Hepburn , Steve McQueen , Sean Connery , Buck Henry , Tippi Hedren , Larry Hagman , Robert Reed , Elizabeth Montgomery , Tina Louise , Barbara Eden , Paul Naschy , Sophia Loren , Bob Denver , Connie Hines , Jack Nicholson , Natalie Wood , Elliott Gould , Elke Sommer , Faye Dunaway and Sandra Dee all having a big orgy ( if you don't know who some of those people are , then shame on you ) . I would have paid to see that kind of movie ! Just kidding ! It's probably sort of weird that I know who every one of those individuals is ! But I still would have paid to see that kind of movie .
406119	2020269	338095	9.0	Voulez Vous Tuer Avec Moi ?	I vividly remember being there during the theater-release of this film in 2003 , here in the French speaking part of Belgium , but it took another two years ( until it was unleashed upon on the American market ) before " Haute Tension " became the gigantic cult bomb it is today . Well , better late than never because , if there really is ONE recently released horror movie that deserves the full attention of every avid genre fan on this planet , it's Alexandre Aja's sensational breakthrough project . " Haute Tension " stands for pure horror and this is not an exaggeration for once ! It's a simple yet effective story with loads of genuine suspense , sublime choreography and a lot of gory shock-moments that can easily be considered as classic already . The story starts off as any ordinary B-thriller , with female friends Marie and Alex driving towards the countryside to stay at Alex ' parental house . No further playtime is wasted after this brief intro , as a nightly perpetrator gruesomely butchers the family members and kidnaps Alex in his ramshackle van . The murders in this film are so exceptionally brutal and graphic that every devoted horror fan will instantly add them to their list of favorites ! We have a new & very inventive decapitation method , some grisly circular saw action , a genuinely unsettling axe-murder and more ? For the first time since his legendary work for gore classics like " The Beyond " , " Cannibal Apocalypse " and " House by the Cemetery " , make-up artist Giannetto De Rossi was offered the opportunity to really go crazy again ! The effects are convincing and very , VERY disturbing . And yet , those who fear that " Haute Tension " is exclusively about blood and guts can still enjoy " Haute Tension " too , since it features some masterfully mounted suspense sequences . The much-discussed ending is my only complaint , and then it's only a small complaint . Clearly influenced by the newest plotting trends in horror , Aja added an abrupt twist ending to his film that is rather hard to take serious . To me personally , this twist is unnecessary ( yet still tolerable ) and I already would have considered " Haute Tension " a success without it . Nonetheless ? great stuff ! ! !
450987	2093818	245803	6.0	Decent , but should have been better	My first though when I saw this was that it was the type of movie Jackie Chan would make ; sidekick that provides comic relief , hero with great martial arts capabilities and an equally strong enemy , corny , at times crude , humor , etc . Then again , I haven't really seen any other movies with Chow Yun-Fat , so I have no idea how his movies usually are ; but I think that given that this movie has so many similarities to a typical Chan movie , it should have been at least a little better ; Chan's movies always seem to have good comedy , entertaining martial arts fights , and a story that allows for plenty of both , without keeping the audiences attention at the plot for any minute over the complete run time of the film . This just seemed to fail at most of these ; the comedy is too much aimed at the teenager audience , apparently trying to cash in on the success of movies such as American Pie , with its innuendo and crude comedy . The martial arts seem to be inspired by Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , which some people will probably say is a good thing ; not me , though . It's too athletic and looks more like dancing than fighting . It especially looks bad since some of it is far more aggressive and intense , which just makes the ballet-like fighting seem even more ridiculous . As for the story , it seems to try to learn you something new , make you think , but it ruins any potential it might have by constantly throwing some ( often bad-looking ) martial arts fight scene in your face , just as you're starting to think more about what Chow just said , which often will sound like something out of a fortune cookie . I also think the plot is too derivative of the same themes and ideas that also inspired The Matrix , which , being far more spectacular than this , will make this seem very inferior , even boarding on being a rip-off ( which I don't feel it is , but it tries too hard to learn you these things as if they had never been told before ) . I know that this is based on a comic book , but it seems too much like a bad excuse to put martial arts in a teenage comedy or vice versa . I don't know if this movie does the comic book any justice , but I wouldn't guess so . I do think that it is good that Seann William Scott and Jaime King performed their martial arts moves themselves , but , this has also been done in The Matrix , and here it seems more like a gimmick ( though I think it was the actors ' choice themselves ) . The plot is OK , but it just barely keeps your attention , and every attempt it does at doing anything else come off as pretentious . The acting is decent enough , nothing great , but not bad either . The characters are a little stereotypical , especially the villains , but they manage to surprise and interest you a little . All in all , a decent enough martial arts teen comedy , but should have been better . I recommend it to fans of teen comedies , martial arts and / or one of the two main actors , since this is probably them both at their best .
420581	2542703	45589	3.0	Go Golf Young Man !	A Martin-Lewis silly farce about two losers who are great at golf . Trouble is that one ( Lewis ) can't shoot well in front of crowds so he becomes Martin's caddy and suffers many indignities along the way . Jerry Lewis does his usual shtick with great competence . His scene of destroying a department store is so similar to that of a Marx Brothers film . Donna Reed , an Oscar winner the same year for " From Here to Eternity , " is along for the ride as Martin's newly-found girl friend . She was far better off in dramatic performances . Martin's sister is played by Barbara Bates . You remember her as that girl from Erasmus Hall High School who hides out in Anne Baxter's apartment at the end of " All About Eve . " After being in this silly nonsense , Bates should have taken the closest plane back to Flatbush and Church Ave . and resume Erasmus attendance . Martin nicely sings " That's Amore , " which was nominated as best song . Argentina Brunetti , who died in Dec . 2005 at 98 , plays his mother . Fred Clark , who always tried to be serious but would come off funny , is victimized in this flick as the Department Store head knocked for a loop by Lewis . No hole in one for this flick . Maybe , a hole in the head for making it .
409970	2567136	24772	8.0	Kids Tough	William Wellman - especially in his early sound films - excelled in telling stories economically thus packing a great deal into 7 or 8 reels . Here he even squanders a whole reel plus in establishing the leading characters as what in England would be called middle class before pulling the rug out from under them via the domino effect of the Great Depression . Grant Mitchell , who made a specialty of parenting - see , for example , Orchestra Wives / Ann Rutherford - is again quietly effective as the matriarch laid off in middle age , but it is Stanley Clements look-alike Frankie Darro who gets top billing as the Andy Hardy type teen who cuts out the Life Lessons from Judge Hardy and gets them instead from the horse's mouth as he takes to the road . This is very much in the Warner Bros ' straight from the headlines ' style and Wellman proves yet again how accomplished he was .
579569	583640	147998	7.0	The bits are greater than the whole .	This is a very funny cartoon , but from a plotting standpoint , it's a mess . The individual gags just happen more or less by happenstance . Ub Iwerks was interested in technique more than content . He was an idea man only when it came to the mechanics of things . A master at what he did and one of the finest animators who ever dipped a pen into an inkwell , but not overly interested in mundane trifles like plots or stories . Tex Avery , master of the machine gun school of sight gags , included something resembling a plot most of the time , even if he simply poked fun at it later . This was Iwerk's Achilles heel and why , at least in part , his studio folded in a few years . His shorts were visually nice , even beautiful in some cases , funny and often just as forgettable as a stale piece of toast . This has some wonderful gags and you may remember the gag for years-but forget which cartoon it was in after two days . The individual parts are better than their sum . Worth watching because the animation is superb . Cotton candy , sumptuous but hardly filling . Recommended with above caveats .
515214	317399	405469	4.0	A Nutshell Review : The Wild	2006 is the year of the animal animation . Earlier in the year , we had the local stinker Zodiac Race , and over the next few months , there are offerings like Over the Hedge , Barnyard , Happy Feet ( no doubt inspired by March of the Penguins ) and Open Season . It's an animal world out there in the world of animation . I'm not too sure why this was made . Sure , the graphics were photo-realistic and crisp , and it had the usual elements of modern day animated flicks . But I guess it's time for filmmakers in this genre to realize that the substance of the story is of paramount importance too . Then again , it's meant strictly for kids . However , even a 3-year old kid who attended the same screening as me , sensed a deja-vu , and didn't take too long to realize that it's so " Madagascar " ( 2005's offering from Dreamworks ) . The premise , if you strip it all down , is also about a group of animals from New York Zoo who made their way ( so the motivations might differ slightly ) to Africa , where they meet nasty native animals , and engage in plenty of mindless song and dance . The Wild also adapted a few more plot elements from its own library like The Lion King , and incorporated the father-son seeking acceptance relationship from last year's died-in-its - own-hype Chicken Little , and borrowed the " I am God , worship me " plot from Ice Age 2 . What gives folks ? I'm aware of some rumours that the filmmakers between the Wild and Madagascar split , and those who jumped shipped to Dreamworks managed to get their product out in the market first . Still , having two movies battling each other , doesn't work well for the one released later . The first half of the movie was bogged down by its melodrama in the fore-mentioned dad - son plot , while the second half dealt out more madcap humour . It's build up to the finale with the bulls wanting to top the food chain , sounded familiar too . There are funny characters abound , but they all lacked somewhat , especially the snake and the giraffe . The joke on the Koala , while fun initially , was repetitive and you'll really want to kick and rip any Koala soft toy out there by the time you're true . The voice talents did a commendable job with the flimsy story , with the likes of Kiefer Sutherland , James Belushi , Janeane Garofalo , and even William Shatner grunting like animals . But the lineup is quite forgettable , especially with rival Dreamworks ' offering in the horizon ( also about animals ! ) Over The Hedge ( Hey , got William Shatner too ! ) As mentioned , the graphics were great though , but the storyline just stinks . I like the way the Lions were done , could have been a showcase of what The Lion King could have looked like if it was conceived some 10 years later . But you probably want to walk out of the theatre as soon as the animals start dancing to the music in the finale . Bad rip-off !
477601	463200	92099	3.0	Top crap	Boring , predictable groaner about a cocky Air Force cadet who needs to learn a few life lessons before becoming a great pilot . Every single cliché is here - - the close buddy that dies so Cruise can " grow up " ; the aeronautics instructor ( or whatever Kelly McGillis played ) in love with him ; the booming tops 40s soundtrack ; the final aerial dogfight where Cruise saves his companions - - - YAWN ! ! ! This movie was a huge hit in 1986 because it gave audiences something safe and predictable . Also the movie has a horrendous performance by Cruise ( he's always bad but he REALLY sucks here - - he grins his way through the entire performance ) , an even worse one by McGillis ( SHE has a PhD in aeronautics ? ? ? ? Hah ! More like one in makeup ! ) , a total lack of sexual chemistry between them , a good ol ' buddy who you know is dogmeat from frame 1 ( Anthony Edwards giving the only good performance ) , another cocky young hothead ( Val Kilmer sneering away ) , a tough but kind leader ( Tom Skerritt , looking totally lost ) and a film that is , basically , an Air Force recruiting poster . Also dogfights that play like video games and the film seems to make war look like kids play . There's also a totally hysterical line when McGillis ( who is about 5 inches taller than Cruise ) looks DOWN at him and breathes , " When I first saw you you were 7 feet tall ! " A total waste of time - - I'm giving it a three cause I like some of the songs ( especially " Take My Breath Away " ) . So buy the soundtrack . . . skip the movie .
572759	4248714	69848	2.0	Carry On Girls	I will admit I didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film , but to be honest , I don't think it would have mattered . Basically local councillor Sidney Fiddler ( Sid James ) persuades the incompetent Mayor Frederick Bumble ( Kenneth Connor ) of Firecombe to hold a beauty contest , to improve the town's image . They face opposition from women's liberationist Augusta Prodworthy ( June Whitfield ) trying to sabotage the contest , but they do have publicity agent Peter Potter ( Bernard Bresslaw ) and Palace Hotel owner Connie Philpotts ( Joan Sims ) . Soon enough the young , beautiful wannabe models show up , including Hope Springs ( Barbara Windsor ) , Paula Perkins ( Valerie Leon ) , Dawn Brakes ( Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan ) , Debra ( Sally Geeson ) and Ida Downs ( EastEnders ' Wendy Richard ) . When the girls have cat fights , it does draw away regular residents , but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and William ( Jack Douglas ) having over-active twitches , it does finally reach the competition , and it's just afterwards I couldn't be bothered . Also starring Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble , Peter Butterworth as Admiral , Joan Hickson as Mrs . Dukes , David Lodge as Police inspector , Angela Grant as Miss Bangor , Arnold Ridley as Councillor Pratt , Robin Askwith as Larry , Patricia Franklin as Rosemary , Jimmy Logan as Cecil Gaybody and Dad's Army's Bill Pertwee as Fire brigade chief , Charles Hawtrey had obviously quit the Carry Ons , but where's Kenneth Williams ? I suppose seeing Babs and young , beautiful looking Pauline Fowler in bikinis , but for comedy value , this fails miserably , and the overuse of the swanny whistle just gets on your nerves . Pretty poor !
423331	2248099	60315	8.0	Lovely little Leone tribute !	As soon as the familiar Spaghetti Western tones hit , you know you're going to be in for a treat and that's what this film certainly is . Franco Nero plays the character that would eventually become synonymous with his name ; the mythical Django . The story takes more than it's fair share of influence from Sergio Leone's ' Dollar ' trilogy , and the plot of this film is pretty much a re-run of the plot that Leone took from Kurosawa's Yojimbo to make ' A Fistful of Dollars ' . We follow the title character , a man that carries his ' burial suit ' around with him ( that's a coffin to you and me ) and saves a young woman from being killed by a group of bandits . When Django takes her back to town , he finds himself in the middle of a feud between those bandits and a group of Mexicans , a situation that he hopes to make the best of for himself . . . It's impossible not to see how Leone's westerns have influenced this film . However , Sergio Corbucci hasn't merely stolen and the result is somewhat original . The classically styled score blends well with the images shown on screen , and some of the sequences in the film are truly powerful . Franco Nero may well be no Clint Eastwood , but he brings charm and credibility to his character and does well with the role , even if he is perhaps slightly too pretty to pull it off to the extent that it could have been done to . The film features lots of mud ( yes , mud ) , and this gives it the dirty , downtrodden feel that is congruent with what audiences have come to expect from the spaghetti western sub-genre . The title tune , which is about the central character is very over the top , and almost comes across as being comical ; but it's a part of the Django film and like the rest of it ; very fun and easy to like . If you like Leone's westerns ( and let's face it , who doesn't ? ) , you'll like this .
504042	2911571	113843	6.0	cheesy updating of " The Bad Seed "	Patty McCormack , who played the original creepy little girl in " The Bad Seed " , has grown up about as well adjusted as you might imagine . She now has a twelve year old daughter that she dotes on , and a few ex-husbands and partners that have gone over to the great beyond , leaving her well taken care of in that process . Of course they ALL had help . The latest beau is Mark , and Jessica Ann likes Mark , and so does Mommy , but he isn't what he appears to be , although he's been seduced and suckered into more than what his job description seems to consist of . Of course Mommy figures it out and Mark is no more . Mommy and Jessica Ann take off for parts unknown , and it comes to Jessica Ann in a dream that Mommy is evil and she has to get away , so she tries , with Mommy in hot pursuit . There is , of course , a police detective on Mommy's tail , what with Jessica Ann's school teacher falling and breaking her neck RIGHT after Jessica Ann doesn't win Student of the Year , etc . And he's quite suspicious of her in general , and rightly so . This is filmed on video , with somewhat mediocre acting , and while the story itself isn't bad the whole " Serial Mom " thing without the humor of John Waters didn't quite do it for me . McCormack is suitably creepy , but more so because of her heavy makeup than because she's a psycho . Anyway , this is OK , it's just not nearly as good as I expected . .
504037	2911571	91209	6.0	21 years later I've just now seen this for the first time . . . .	For some reason The Hitcher never had my interest when it came out in the mid-80's , and I rarely missed any kind of horror film that came out back in those days . So last night I remembered that I've had the DVD sitting on my shelf for about TWO years now , and dragged it out , and watched it , and I have to say that I was not that impressed . C . Thomas Howell plays a rather bland character called Jim Halsey , that is transporting someone's car to San Diego from Chicago . He keeps referring to the car as a " drive-away " , like everyone knows what that means & nobody questions it , I'd never heard the term before . At any rate he picks up a hitch hiker in the pouring rain , telling the man ( who is of course Rutger Hauer ) that his mom told him never to do this . Of course , in this case , mom could never have been more right , because within the first few miles Hauer tells him that he'll cut off his legs , arms , and head , and so of course Jim pulls over to the side of the road & asks his rider to politely to get the hell out . He begins to then closes the door again , but not quite tightly enough & is knocked right out the door by Jim who is home free again until he sees his former passenger in another car with a man , wife , and kids , heading for the brink of hell . Of course , he finds their car later , over at the side of the road , and apparently what he sees inside doesn't sit well with him as he's suddenly vomiting by the roadside . And so begins a long , drawn out cat & mouse game between Hauer & Howell , which at times is so improbable that it's ridiculous . But this IS a movie , so it's OK , I guess . Of course , Howell has been set up , framed , made to look like HE'S the loony , while Hauer keeps to the background mostly and pops up now and again to dig Howell a deeper grave . Along the way Jim ( Howell ) picks up Jennifer Jason Leigh , a waitress at a truck stop , and she believes he's innocent and ends up coming along for the ride and becoming an accomplice of sorts . Of course , Hauer has blown away a couple cops too and every redneck with a badge and gun from miles around have all got vengeance in mind and are out to shoot first and ask questions later . Most notable is a scene where Hauer brings down a police helicopter with a hand gun , and he's not really even looking when he does it . What a guy . Anyway , Howell & Leigh hang out in some hotel to freshen up a bit and decide what they're going to do & of course Hauer appears while Howell's in the shower and Leigh is napping , and soon she's tied between two trucks in a " Perils of Pauline " sort of situation , and Hauer's still just getting warmed up . There's a rather strange " relationship " between Hauer & Howell , that's not fully defined , but is not exactly wholesome , I'd say . Of course eventually someone gets hold of this loony and he's held in custody , at least for a while . . . it's almost like Hauer is the heir-apparent to Michael Myers for longevity , but so far there's only been one sequel to this and Hauer isn't in it . And I haven't seen THAT one either . I don't know , some people apparently feel like this is a classic but I don't hold it in such high esteem . Which may be why it only took me 21 years after its release to see it . .
423685	2248099	405159	8.0	Eastwood triumphs yet again	Usually when the latest ' big thing ' gets released , I go to cinema and end up disappointed . With Million Dollar Baby , however ; that was not the case . Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw , gritty realism . The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured , no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge , and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline . Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene , which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score , before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions . This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it . Clint Eastwood made a name for himself by playing a character that you cant possibly disagree with . In movies like Sergio Leone's ' Dollar ' trilogy , down to his own films , such as High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven ; we are with Clint every step of the way , no matter what evil deeds he's doing . He perfected the anti-hero and proved that an audience can be fully behind any character . For this movie , Clint has given himself a support role , and all the faith that we would usually put him has been transferred to Hilary Swank . Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in this movie , and anyone that says otherwise is sadly mistaken . She approaches her role with all the determination that epitomises her character on screen , and delivers a fine performance with it . Emotionally as well as physically , Swank never gives us a reason to doubt that she is Maggie Fitzgerald ; the character she plays on screen . If Swank doesn't walk away with the Best Actress award for 2004 , there is something seriously wrong . Despite taking a back step , Eastwood still manages to retain that which he made his name with . Once again , Eastwood is the downbeat loner - the man who comes along and changes thing ; the catalyst of the story . This performance is much more mature than the work Eastwood did in his earlier movies , and may well go on to represent the twilight years of this classic actor . The way that Eastwood gets the audience behind his central character is simply breathtaking . During the boxing scenes especially , Clint's subdued style lends them a potent realism and the audience feels every punch thrown and every wound endured . The boxing scenes are also testament to Eastwood's triumph with characterisation as well as technical potency , as we follow Maggie Fitzgerald every step of the way . When she takes a punch , we feel it too and when she delivers a blow - the audience is able to feel the adrenaline pumping , the same as the character does on screen . It's one of the hardest things to make an audience feel for a character , but Million Dollar Baby , not satisfied with just making us feel ? allows us to become one with the emotions on screen . However , all is not rosy in the almost perfect garden that Eastwood has created . Basically , it's the musical score . Million Dollar Baby is a powerful film , and just the images and dialogue alone is enough to convey the story to the audience and make them feel for the characters - but for some reason , many scenes are saturated in a horrible rural style beat and it doesn't do the film any favours at all . Music almost always adds to the images on screen , but sometimes no music is better . I almost feel like I'm nitpicking as the film is so close to perfection , but it's a niggling little aspect of it that annoyed me . Million Dollar Baby is not one of those films that comes along and changes the cinematic landscape . However , it's a powerful drama with some excellent acting , great direction and a brilliant storyline . I'm not a boxing fan , but when it comes to films like this ; it doesn't matter what you like . Usually when I go to the cinema , there's a mad rush to the doors at the end ? no matter what the film ? but this wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby . Everyone in the cinema sat in their seats until the end credits rolled , and although I cant speak for everyone ; I did so because the film is so utterly spellbinding and I needed the time for the credits to roll to catch my breath . I don't need to say this but I will : see this movie .
407678	865972	104115	7.0	An enjoyable fantasy from Full Moon .	Two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension , one ( Brian Thompson as a Kabal ) trying to destroy the Earth , the other ( Jeffrey Combs as a Anton Mordrid ) trying to save it . " Doctor Mordrid " is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese . The plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent , but the film is very short and entertaining . So if you have enough time to kill give this one a look . My rating : .
564044	102816	100403	10.0	A vastly superior sequel . Absolutely brilliant .	' Silent , Invisible , Invincible . He's in town with a few days to kill . ' Has there ever a tagline cooler than this ? I'm telling you there hasn't . Long , long , long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves . Why all of a sudden ? Because when standing next to the extremely crap AvP , it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie was not in it . Fair enough , a Terminator , Conan or even Commando film without Arnie just wouldn't work . But the 7-foot tall , Rastafarian , otherworldly hunter is the star of this film and this time round he gets much , much more screen time . We all know what the Predator is so Stephen Hopkins shows off this ace instead of hiding it up his sleeve . The year is 1997 and the City of Angels is boiling under a 109-degree heatwave . Columbian and Jamaican drug lords have turned the streets into a war-zone . The police are out-manned and out gunned and incompetent . The last thing they need to deal with is the Predator . The titular hunter has returned with an increased arsenal of weapons and is keen on slicing and dicing the aforementioned druggies for fun . During a brutal gun-battle on the streets he watches Lieutenant Mike Harrigan ( Danny Glover ) , a slightly-crazed renegade cop , blow away half a dozen Columbian scumbags and chooses him as his ultimate prey . Naturally , Harrigan and his ethnically diverse team of cops have enough problems without having to worry about their skulls ending up in the Pred's intergalactic trophy cabinet . Making matters worse is faux-DEA Agent Peter Keyes ( Gary Busey ) who pretends to be after the druggies but is really more interested in swiping the Pred's advanced technology . Yeah , good luck with that ! From start to finish Predator 2 is brash , unsubtle , in-your-face wall-to-wall action . A hectic , breathtaking succession of non-stop , increasingly exciting set-pieces . The final 45 minutes will you wetting yourself with excitement I kid you not . While Hopkins ( fresh from his Nightmare on Elm Street 5 debut ) has remained constantly employed he's never really become a star director , which is a shame since he has a slick , cartoonish style and is far more talented than most other anonymous directors . Like John McTiernan did in the first , he provokes a dusty , sweaty and overbearingly hot atmosphere in the daytime scenes and an alien , Gothic feel to night ( pun intended ) . The way he captures LA on film just makes you NEVER want to go there . Fans of Alan Silvestri's score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back ( they were rudely ditched for AvP ) and more evolved . It's probably the most engaging score he's done . His Latin drums , sinister , shrieking , Hermann-esquire strings , yawning , haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice . But it ain't just that . Everything from set-design and cinematography to sound-design and film editing is nothing short of brilliant . If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself . There's nothing mass-produced or conveyor-belt about Predator 2 . Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be . Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best . It's sad that action films like this are not made anymore . Predator 2 is a classic , the kind of movie that feels torn straight from the pages of a 1950's pulp detective novel and crossed with a Twilight Zone episode . , no doubt .
497657	1355507	74434	1.0	Awful horror film , the sort of film the fast forward button was invented for .	This film opens with the on screen caption " on August 10th in a California Drive-In it all began . . . " A young couple are murdered while sitting in their car at a drive-in watching a film , by an unknown psycho with a large oriental sword . Two fat cops Mike and John ( James Barnes and Micheal Alden ) are put on the case , but unfortunately when it comes to solving the crime and capturing the killer these guys are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard . They interrogate a few people connected with the drive-in , Germy ( Douglas Gudbye ) the all round dogsbody , and Atkin Johnson ( Newton Naushaus ) the hilariously bad tempered and foul mouthed manager . This leads to a funny conversation between the two cops and Atkins , Atkins says teenagers are dicks and one of the cops replies " well , I have two of them " referring to the two dead kids from the opening sequence , the other cop quickly buts in and says " teenagers that is ! " , funny stuff and it doesn't end there . The cops helpfully observe " well , she's in pretty bad shape , she was murdered with a sword " and when they want to talk with Atkins again one says " lets go get that bald headed garbage can ! " Anyway , they are baffled , the only lead they have is a man named Orville ( Norman Sherlock ) who hangs around the drive-in and spy's on people in their cars having sex , but when questioned by the two cops he claims he had nothing to do with the killings and he says " I just wanted to beat my meat ! " , hey that's what the guy said . All their leads come to dead ends . Will the two cops be able to unmask the killer in time , before more innocent lives are lost ? Co-written , produced and directed by Stuart Segall this is just plain terrible . The acting is awful as is the photography and music . There are a couple of good gore scenes , a decapitation , a slit throat and an impaling , there just should have been more of them . But that's nowhere near a good enough reason to sit through this rubbish . The script by George ' Buck ' Flowers and John F . Goff is slow , dull , boring and predictable . There's a scene where the two fat cops stakeout the drive-in , in disguise . One of them dresses in drag , he looks ridiculous and then they start to have a stupid conversation about where he's going to pee ! There is also another scene where two victims are watching an unknown film in their car , the guy says " what a turkey ! " and " this plots been done before " , you will know exactly how he feels , I also wondered if his dialogue was included by the filmmakers as a little self referring joke , it sums up the film well . Half the film appears to be padding , there's a five minute sequence in which Germy walks around a funfair for absolutely no reason whatsoever , among other pointlessly drawn out scenes . The ending is also one of the worst ever , nothing is concluded . One to avoid . This does have a great tag line on the video cover though , ' You'll pay to get in . . . and pray to get out ! ! ' , that's true enough , you'll pray to get out alright , just way before this thing finishes .
574024	4532636	399146	8.0	A Haunting Film	Viggo Mortensen has been allowed to shed the silly , macho , grizzled locks and attitude he was forced to don for three long years in a row for the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy , and has finally been given the chance to play a real character , that of Tom Stall , steady-eddie dad and husband , who may or may not be hiding a shocking and violent past . Mortensen is terrific in this movie . It's one of those performances whose quality could be easily underestimated , because it's not a flashy role . No doubt at the end of the year , he will be overlooked for a bunch of actors who chew the scenery in phony Hollywood biopics , but such is the way of popular entertainment . Mortensen deserves accolades for this movie , and I hope other directors are paying attention to him . David Cronenberg's " A History of Violence " is a disturbing reflection on the pervasiveness of violence in our culture , the tendency to turn to violence first as a means of settling conflict , and the vicious cycle a reliance on violence can cause . In other words , violence breeds violence . I don't know that Cronenberg necessarily has anything new to say on the subject , but he has fashioned a haunting and memorable movie from the theme . Maria Bello was considered by many to be woefully overlooked for her performance in " The Cooler " from two years ago ; my hunch is the community will make that oversight up to her this year for her performance as Tom Stall's wife . It's refreshing to see a wife / mother character who is required to do more than suffer nobly . Bello creates a vivid , strong , three-dimensional picture of a wife who has her entire world pulled out from under her and the steps she takes to deal with it . It's also nice for a change to see a movie where the violence matters , and has consequences . When violence occurs in this movie , it is quick and startling - - there are moments when I wanted to look away from the screen . It just barely avoids being gratuitous , though , because it's not treated lightly . Part of the importance of the film's message is seeing what a bullet will do to a human face . Cronenberg approaches the material in a typically strange fashion ( though this is one of the more accessible Cronenberg films ) . It varies widely in tone : the tense , brooding atmosphere created whenever criminals are part of the scene ; the almost funny picture painted by Cronenberg of an idyllic American small town , complete with bouncy music and a quaint main street ; the action movie quality that takes over whenever Mortensen's character springs into action . I'm not sure Cronenberg is entirely successful at blending these disparate elements , but I can appreciate what he was trying to do , and I felt that he was always in total control of his movie and made the finished product he wanted to make . So far , the Oscar-bait season of 2005 has been an unusually ripe one for tough and relevant films . Maybe the industry is finally reacting to and the depressing , dispiriting hole American has fallen into since then at the hands of the Bush Administration . The last period of social and political unrest in America resulted in some of the best films ever made . Could we be on the verge of another period of greatness ? Here's hoping .
437347	306861	26249	10.0	Historical Spectacle - DeMille Style	A playboy king & a beautiful princess . A holy hermit & a sacred mission . Intrigue & romance & sin & spectacle . In fact , another Cecil B . DeMille history lesson . This time , DeMille takes on THE CRUSADES , a highly complex military & political enterprise that actually played out over 200 years . He focuses on one episode : The Third Crusade & England's King Richard the Lionheart's thrust to claim Jerusalem & the Holy Land from the Seljuk Turks in 1188-1192 . Interestingly enough , DeMille gets a lot of his historical facts correct , but he does spend quite a bit of time detailing Richard's lustful , wanton ways . Literature & film have tended to wildly romanticize Richard . In historical fact , he was a bad king interested primarily in his own glory . He spent only 6 months of his reign in Britain , he bankrupted the Treasury with his Crusading schemes and he abandoned his young wife . But such is the power of Romance that he is generally seen as the beau ideal of kingliness . Henry Wilcoxon is a good , sturdy , if unspectacular , Richard . Loretta Young is beautiful , as always , as the Princess he marries . Sir C . Aubrey Smith is magnificent as the Holy Hermit who is the spiritual leader of the Crusade . Others in the fine cast are Alan Hale , Joseph Schildkraut , Mischa Auer & John Carradine ( pay close attention to find him ) . As a master of spectacle , DeMille really comes through towards the end of the film with the siege & capture of Acre ( north of present day Haifa in Israel ) . All the stops are pulled out to show the full panoply & horror of mediaeval battle .
409539	2567136	486474	8.0	My Defenses Are Down	One of the plus factors about this excellent thriller is that unless you happen to live there you wouldn't know you were in Paris ; a few years ago there was an equally fine thriller , A La Petite Semaine which was shot largely in Porte de Clignacourt , North Paris whilst this one was shot mainly a few miles West in La Defense ( whose Metro station was used to great effect in Buffet Froid . There have been several notable French films in this genre lately , indeed the most recent , Ne le dis a personne ( Tell No One ) has only just finished making the rounds , and now here is yet another perhaps just a notch or two below ' personne ' but still very , very good . The two have elements in common , an ordinary man suddenly involved in a nightmare and coming under suspicion of murder , there's even a chase sequence similar to but briefer and less tense than the one with Vincent Cluzet which is not the same as saying that Yvan Attal is not every bit as fine an actor as Cluzet and he more than holds his own against Clovis Cornillac ( who also had a large role in A La Petite Semaine ) who has by far the ' showier ' role as a psychotic obsessed with vengeance for a childhood prank that went wrong . Why they had to go to Finland for Attal's wife I'll never know - his own long-time real life partner Charlotte Gainsbourg could have played it equally well - but Minna Haapkyla is certainly adequate . All in all this is a stylish thriller and more than worth watching out for .
552748	989035	405159	5.0	Ready-built for tragedy	Clint Eastwood's directorial career has brought forth some very spotty pictures ; when he loses his dryly-askew sense of humor , Eastwood becomes a muddled , one-dimensional filmmaker . " Million Dollar Baby " is much better than " Mystic River " in that it features sympathetic characters , multi-layered performances and an intriguing scenario that doesn't initially seem to follow a by-the-numbers formula . By the second-half however , both the script and Eastwood's agendas change drastically ( not from a boxing movie into a character study , that would be too easy ; it becomes something even more sentimental ) . It's certainly easy for the viewer to flow with the changes - - Eastwood's professionalism provides a smooth contrast in moods and scenario - - but it's a disappointing right-turn , and nothing is really done with the new venue . It seems to say that life is rough , for the female boxer , for the manager , for the assistant , and for the ( God help us ) spindly-legged mental kid who hangs out at the gym ( in a gratuitous sub-plot designed to give mentor Morgan Freeman a few extra scenes ) . An occasionally unpleasant and queasy picture with built-in pathos and over-the-top writing , the movie takes a good while to get cooking , but does provide some solid drama . Eastwood never lapses into soap opera , he's an intelligent and caring actor and director ( and provides somber , quietly effective mood music on the soundtrack besides ) , but the assembly-line progression of situations are disappointingly trotted out , and even though the finale is moving , the set-up for it is almost mechanical . from
585739	783721	218967	7.0	A good watch family men and women .	A sort of contempo redux of Dickens Christmas Carol , Cage plays a wealthy and very eligible bachelor on Wall Street who suddenly finds himself married with children . Yeah , this is another romantic comedy in a very tired genre . However , it is a cut above the average sap dripping chick flick as it doesn't wade in goo , has a crisp script , keeps moving , is genuinely funny , and tries hard not to be predictable . Fresh stuff with good chemistry between Cage and Leoni .
514593	317399	268380	7.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Ice Age ( 2002 )	I've missed this animated movie when it was out in Singapore a few years back . Since the sequel is hitting our shores real soon , I thought I'd better get myself up to speed with the original movie , lest I miss out on some references used in the sequel . You see , must do homework mah ? It has been 4 years since this movie was released , but I am marveled at the level of animation detail that was already incorporated - the ice never looked as white or as menacing , and the scenes of water in this movie , could have been the real thing . It really is that good . Which is quite surprising , considering that Ice Age was only Fox Animation Studios ' attempt after their initial offering of Titan AE . The beginning of Ice Age comprised of that extra long trailer featuring Scrat ( the part squirrel part rat animal ) trying to bury its acorn into the ice . Yes , it's the same one , which lead directly to a scene which looked straight out of A Land Before Time . The prehistoric animals are making their way down south , but somehow , Manny the Mammoth decides to leave the herd , and head up north instead . He meets Sid the Sloth , and they begin an uneasy alliance - you know , the usual bored character meets witty-but-irritating character routine . At the same time , some sabre-tooth tigers have ambushed some early-humans ( they don't speak ) , and their prized target , a human baby , escapes . Diego gets appointed by the pack to hunt the baby down and deliver it , so that they can exact revenge . But alas the baby gets saved rather reluctantly by Manny and Sid , and Diego has to use its cunning to infiltrate the group , and complete its mission . It's a simple movie with mature themes , infused with madcap comedy . I especially enjoyed the crazy sequence with the dumb dodo birds - after watching this , you'd think that they deserve to be extinct ! But anyhow , central to the themes is that of sacrifice and friendship . It got played out really well , since you have a double agent amongst the group of unlikely friends . And it is precisely this that the sequel can be born . As with most animation flicks these days , look out for some spoofs , especially in the cave ( with the UFO ) , and pay close attention to the dialog - lots of gems to listen out for . It's an interesting caper , and the sequel , yes I'm awaiting . This Code 1 , two-discs special edition comes with features filled to the brim . The first disc contains an audio commentary , interactive games , both widescreen and fullscreen formats , and the usual audio selection and subtitles . The second discs comes with an animated short Scrat's Missing Adventure , an HBO behind the scenes special , a making-of documentary , 6 deleted scenes , 6 production featurettes , trailers , and a clip from Blue Sky Studio's Oscar winning film " Bunny " . Whew !
460340	2467618	16895	8.0	excellent Lloyd film	Okay , I'll admit that this isn't Harold Lloyd's best picture . However , even a second-rate Lloyd feature is still an excellent movie and well worth your time due to its excellent story telling and acting . Harold is a young multi-millionaire who falls for the daughter of a social reformer in the poor part of town . Harold wants to help them - - mostly because he finds Jobyna Ralston to be quite a hot tamale - - something that seems to occur in all their films . At one point , to help her and her missionary father , Harold runs throughout the slums starting fights and irritating people in order to get them to chase him . Ultimately he leads these dozens of men into the mission where he is able to persuade them to stay and the mission is a success . This is a cute gag sequence . What happens after this and the climatic chase sequence is certainly nothing new - - it all reminds you of many other Lloyd films . But considering how well-made it is , this can be forgiven .
450231	2093818	80801	8.0	Innocence meets Benny Hill-esquire slapstick in a very sweet film	Comedy is an art that can take many forms , and can be seen more places than more or less any other . Almost anywhere you search , you may find it by looking closely . Many would argue that slapstick reminiscent of the late Benny Hill isn't the greatest expression of the comedic arts , but it's difficult to dispute that it's one that anyone understands ( if not everyone will find it funny ) . Here , that type of humor is meshed ( and with quite good results ) with the innocence of Bushmen who have never seen modern society . There are three story lines ; following Xixo , a Bushman who has technology thrust upon him in the form of an object common in civilization , Andrew Steyn , a young man who works in Botswana ( where the whole film is set ) and a malevolent man fighting the government . These story lines run parallel each other very well , and the overall plot is rather good , for the production . The pacing is relatively even , and the movie neither moves too fast nor too slowly . The comedy is almost all in the form of the slapstick , and there is occasional cleverness in the dialog . It all goes together well , and makes for a very funny movie . The innocence and the general tone of the film makes it very sweet ( without being sappy ) , and though few will make the claim that it is an unpredictable piece , it's a nice little film , one to take your mind off bad things and just relax ( in-between the laughing ) . An inexpensive movie that doesn't look cheap . The humor is very well balanced ; it never tries too hard , and it is almost invariably successful at getting the laughs . Seeing Xixo be introduced to modern conveniences , and respond with the naiveté ( which is perfectly accentuated by the narrator ) is heartening , and watching how he adapts to it is a testament to human ingenuity . A simple film , but one that can be watched by just about anyone at any time . The slapstick does get a little violent at times , but it's cartoon-y violence ( think Tom and Jerry ) . It shows little actual consequence of violent actions . . . for better or for worse . I recommend this to any fan of slapstick and physical comedy . Very good for what it is .
493352	3280905	37138	6.0	Stan and Ollie in decline .	All the great movie comics made poor comedies in comparison to their best ones . For every THE BANK DICK and IT'S A GIFT , W . C . Fields did a MRS . WIGGS OF CABBAGE PATCH or ALICE IN WONDERLAND . For every DUCK SOUP and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA , the Marx Brothers did a LOVE HAPPY or a STORY OF MANKIND . Chaplin's MODERN TIMES and MONSIEUR VERDOUX is " balanced " by A KING IN NEW YORK and A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG . Keaton's THE GENERAL and SHERLOCK JR . have the negatives of WHAT , NO BEER or BOOM IN THE MOON . For all of Abbott and Costello's THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES or BUCK PRIVATES , one has to look at DANCE WITH ME HENRY . The same with Laurel & Hardy . Their last ten films , for M . G . M . and 20th Century Fox are dismissed . I think the reason is that these films lack the atmosphere built up by Hal Roach and his production staff . But what is forgotten is how often Roach and Laurel ( the real creative half of the team ) failed to agree on film production . SWISS MISS appears to have been butchered , in part , by Roach . There are probably other examples , particularly as Laurel wanted more expensive budgets on his films ( such as the nightclub in OUR RELATIONS ) while Roach constantly tried to clamp down on expenses . When they joined MGM Laurel & Hardy were still quite popular , but the leading comic team of that moment ( 1941 ) was Universal's Abbott & Costello . Though similar in physical juxtaposition ( thin Stan and Bud v . fat Ollie and Lou ) the personalities were widely different . Stan was not a wise guy like Bud Abbott , and Ollie had more misplaced self-confidence than timid Lou Costello ) . But the films that were given to them were somewhat like those of Abbott & Costello . The latter's BUCK PRIVATES is mirrored in L & H's GREAT GUNS . It was like the MGM studio did not really know what to do with them - and probably that is true . Don't forget how Louis B . Mayer had little sympathy with comedians - witness his actions against the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton . Why should Laurel & Hardy get any better treatment ? The last ten films then have to be judged by this background of neglect . As such , one looks for whatever is positive in them . Sometimes it is surprising . SPOILERS COMING UP The best moments in NOTHING BUT TROUBLE deal with Stan and Ollie trying to cook and serve their employers ( Henry O'Neill and Mary Boland ) , and the conclusion with Philip Merivale's poisoning plot against his nephew . The business with Stan offering a saw to cut the piece of purloined steak is wonderful . But the business with Merivale is quite unique . It is similar to the situation in the Marx Brothers ' THE BIG STORE , where in the concluding chase in the store Douglas Dumbrille , the film's villain , starts taking over the comic punctuation of the sequence , and carries them off quite well ( in fact , he takes over the film ) . Here Merivale does , in particular when the poisoned canapé is mixed up so thoroughly by the boys that Merivale does not know which important social / political / financial figure at the party is going to eat the poisoned piece . Momentarily he thinks it is Mary Boland , but it just appears she swallowed the wrong way . But Merivale goes through the tortures of the damned until the end of the sequence . And , as it turns out , there is a neat wrap up to the matter just before the film concludes . It is sort of symptomatic to the trouble of Mayer's lack of concern approach with his pure humorist - he so did not care about the actual finished product , that he was willing to let the film's villains take over the comedy . It makes one appreciate Merrivale more , just like THE BIG STORE makes one regard Dumbrille more highly . But it really does not add much luster to L & H anymore than the other added to the reputations of the Marx Brothers .
579419	583640	39043	7.0	Something of a historical curiousity now , interesting but dated .	This documentary , nominated for an Academy Award , is a look back in time at the traffic problems in and around Los Angeles circa 1946 . Interesting but qute dated , it does show that Los Angeles had problems with traffic flows even 55 years ago . Turner Classic Movies runs this occasionally and invariably runs it in March as part of its " 31 Days of Oscar " programming . Worth watching .
513609	3223254	428856	7.0	Look at Me , See Me , Do I Exist ?	LA MOUSTACHE is a very well acted and conceived Belgian film that starts with a terrific premise that could be the opening for either a comedy or a drama and ends up wondering which path to take . Writer / director Emmanuel Carrère ( with co-script writer Jérôme Beaujour ) takes us on a mind trip that becomes increasingly disorienting and frustrating as the film progresses . It challenges the audience to think but then there is no payoff for the effort . Marc ( Vincent Lindon ) is a handsome middle aged man married to Agnès ( Emmanuelle Devos ) for fifteen years and one morning , in what in retrospect is in response to a bit of relationship ennui , decides to shave off his mustache which has always been present since his marriage began . The surprise to Marc is that Agnès doesn't even notice . At work Marc quietly shows up and no one notices , not even his close associate Bruno ( Hippolyte Girardot ) . Marc is at first perplexed , then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his mustache and no one believes that he ever had one ! Marc begins to search for photos showing his previous face and gradually the photos disappear and his wife denies ever seeing them , ever traveling to Bali where the photos were taken , etc . People begin to wonder about Marc's sanity and his wife suggests he seek psychiatric care . It is at this point that Marc enters a fugue state and ultimately disappears to Hong Kong on a never ending quest for discovering the truth about who he really is , whether he actually exists , whether he is the pawn in a cosmic game . . . . it just gets more ludicrous . Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos are superb in this peculiar roles and the film has solid production values . Perhaps it is the director's point to leave the audience in a confused state , one that calls forth the existential questions , but as a film it merely peters out , leaving the viewer a bit frustrated by the lack of substance .

544561	562732	89173	2.0	The worst one yet .	Contains Spoilers ! The movie starts out with a nightmare that Tommy Jarvis is having . You remember Tommy , played by Corey Feldman in Part 4 , evidently he's grown up to a fabulous future as a mental patient . Thankfully , this was a dream , since it features two nutcases whooping and hollering as they dig Jason out of his grave , where he is buried under about 3-4 inches of soft dirt , and apparently buried wearing his hockey mask and with a stabbing weapon in each hand . Brilliant . Tommy awakens on the way to the mental hospital , around which most of the rest of the movies revolves . In the movie's defense , at least it wasn't yet another slopfest about a lot of teenagers going up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed just like we already knew they would . They are running out of inventive ways to cut up young people for that to drive yet another Friday the 13th installment . Unfortunately , they seem to have decided that since they added a few new gimmicks to the movies , like a mental hospital , a Jason impersonator , and some shockingly dirty rednecks , they didn't need to come up with any new death scenes . Not exactly the most intellectual necessity , but creative deaths are about 85 % of what has always driven this series , and in this one we get more of the same boring killings - a machete pushed through the stomach ( on two separate occasions in this movie , I think ) , slashes across the chest / face , etc . In one scene , Jason plunges a pair on hedge-clippers through some poor girls eyes , but then they screwed it up because we get a shot upwards of his hands holding the clippers and roughly pushing them together , indicating that he had beheaded her . Then we see her and she was just stabbed through the eyes . Why include that shot if it's completely wrong as far as what he did to her ? At any rate , the nutty people who inform the cast that they're all doomed are rather interesting as the above-mentioned dirty rednecks , except they run up to the cast when they're at the mental hospital surrounded by police ( to find out why you have to watch the movie yourself ) , and they run up screaming threats , upset that there is a mental hospital filled with punk teenagers so close to their home . Pretty funny scene , except the woman threatens to kill the next person who comes near their house , then she expands her threat to include the police officers , then she informs the lot of them that she is currently strapped with dynamite and would blow them all to hell if they don't watch their step . Just so you know , if you threaten to even punch someone and there is a police officer within earshot , consider yourself arrested . A verbal threat is assault , and can land you in jail . This woman threatened to kill the kids , the police officer , and then to blow herself up , killing everyone in sight , and the cops just smile as she jumps on the motorcycle with her nutcase son and rides off with him , taking with her the dynamite and any respect I might have had for these cops . Later on , we see these rednecks at home as she is chopping up a chicken , screeching all the while , to feed to her idiot son , and they are approached by a man who knocks on the door , asking if they have any work he can do for some food ( he hasn't eaten in two days ) , so she puts him to work cleaning out the chicken coop and then he can come back and get his stomach filled . Why was this guy in the movie at all ? He literally serves absolutely no purpose other than to inform the audience that these people have a chicken coop that needs cleaning and so that he can be another person for Jason to kill . If they didn't think they had a large enough cast of teenagers for Jason to plow through , I would have suggested just adding a few more characters rather than adding in some wandering oddball in a wife-beater looking for a meal . Instead we have this guy with no part in the movie except that of a hungry victim . ( spoilers ) One of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film concerns her son , who gets beat up down at the mental hospital by Tommy , so he rides home on his motorcycle , screaming that those damn kids made him mad . Rather than going inside to express his anger to his mother , this ridiculous moron rides around the yard on his bike , spinning doughnuts and doing wheelies and screaming at the top of his lungs all the while , flying recklessly around the yard until he either slams into a tree , killing himself , or gets beheaded by a butcher knife that pops out of the bushes . We get the latter , but either would have been satisfying enough , as long as it shut that idiot up . The second of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film is the one where Demon , the older brother of one of the younger but more prominent characters in the movie , takes turns singing ' Hey baby baby ' over and over to his girlfriend on the other side of the craphouse wall . VERY romantic . On the other hand , what the hell else would you expect from someone with a name like Demon ? I guess this was the only thing they could come up with I order to make Demon get concerned when his girlfriend stopped singing back to him . His death , however , was among the more interesting of all of the ones in the movie . Thus brings up a rather important plot point about this movie , that the killer in the hockey mask is not even Jason , but Jason being impersonated by someone , whose identity and motives are revealed at the end of the film after his pretty impressive death scene . Fans might be disappointed that it's not even Jason in this movie , since he was killed in Part 4 , but that doesn't really matter for the most part , because even though it's really just some guy doing all the killing , he is still just as relentless , stolid , and basically impervious to damage as the original . He makes no sounds , doesn't run , and of course can't be killed until enough people have been killed to fulfill an hour and a half running time . This should have opened up a lot of possibilities for the movie , since the last time there was any element of mystery was in Part 1 when the real killer was not Jason Voorhees but his mother , seeking revenge against the kids who brought about the death of her son . But nope , the only mystery is that the killer is not really Jason , who the films makers decided to leave dead for this installment ( viewers at the time of its release were probably expected to expect some sort of ' Evil Never Dies ' resurrection very soon to follow ) , but the ham-handed hints leave all but the most dense viewers very aware of the killer's real identity long before his mask ever comes off . This is surely one of the most hated of the Friday installments among the series ' fans , most likely because the real Jason does not appear , but only in name , almost . For the entire film except for the scenes that hint at the killer's identity and the scene where his mask comes off at the end , he is the real Jason . He acts and moves exactly like him , so the basic attraction of the movie is there , I suppose , but it reminds me of the popular failure of Halloween III , the one which completely departed from the premise of the first two films , having absolutely nothing to do with Michael Meyers or Laurie Strode . They wisely returned to the original story in part IV , even going so far as to attach the subtitle ' The Return of Michael Meyers ' and put a big picture of his mask on the movie's poster . The next Friday film does exactly the same thing , adding on the subtitle ' Jason lives , ' as though to say , ' Sorry about that last movie ! He's alive in this one ! ' I love the subtlety of these movies . So this movie is probably considered by many people , such as myself , to be the worst installment in the series , but not only because it wasn't really Jason as the killer . That's probably only about 90 % of the reason . The other 10 % is things like the ones mentioned above . Logic is abandoned even more than in the other movies ( Tommy , for example , is admitted to a mental hospital that not only exists in the exact location of the cause of his mental instability , but also allows him to keep such things as the horror movie masks that he made as a kid and , shockingly enough , a four-inch pocket-knife ) , a guy is introduced who has no part in the movie or the series other than to get killed , etc . But I think it remains a curiosity piece , in that it is so clearly an experiment by the filmmakers to try something a little different , have it fail miserably , and then promptly return to the general formula in the next movie .
519438	8239592	122116	8.0	An incredibly awful ( and hilarious ) 70's blaxploitation hoot	Successful and respected black doctor Kenneth Kincade ( the hopelessly wooden J . Walter Smith , who comes across like a poor man's William Marshall ) and his family move into an affluent California suburb populated by grotesquely hateful and intolerant evil snobby white jerks . Said jerks not only protest in front of the Kincade's house and leave a coffin on the front lawn , but also string up the family's pet cat after they brutally butcher the poor kitty . Dr . Kincade enlists the aid of bold and fearsome black militant Abar ( bald , charismatic Tobar Mayo ) and his followers to protect his family . After his son gets killed by the vile racists , Dr . Kincade injects Abar with an experimental serum that makes him indestructible and gives him special psychic powers . Sporting an immaculate blue suit and red shirt , Abar decides to clean up the streets : Among the good deeds he performs are turning wine into milk , making a purse snatcher return his stolen item to its rightful owner , forcing a bunch of graffiti artists to repaint a wall they just defaced , and , best of all , unleashing a hurricane and plague of rats on the wholly deserving Caucasian villains . Boy , is this one fabulously freaky and stunningly clunky micro-budget blaxploitation oddity : Frank Packard's plodding ( mis ) direction , James Smalley's talky , yet genuinely offbeat and unpredictable script , the authentically grimy inner city Los Angeles locations , the endearingly amateurish acting by a no-name cast ( Roxie Young as Ms . Kincade cops the grand booby prize ; check out her big crack-up scene after discovering the mangled body of her murdered son ) , Ron Garcia's rough , static cinematography , the infrequent ineptly staged action scenes , the funky 70's TV cop show-style score , and the totally unexpected from out in left field uplifting conclusion all make this deliciously loopy doozy one of the single most gloriously weird and original jaw-droppers produced during the 70's blaxploitation craze . Must be seen to be ( dis ) believed .
505321	2911571	68370	8.0	classic low-budget early 70's low budget horror	I saw this back in the early 80's on some late night horror show like Creature Features ( KTVU , Oakland ! ) and I loved it , and just watched it on DVD last night and it stands the test of time . Not that it isn't dated , oh my , the fashions of the day , striped trousers , etc . Talk about scary . The story is that an acting troupe led by the pompous and hammy Alan ( played by Alan Ormsby ) go to an island of the coast of south Florida to mess around in a graveyard and cast some spells . Unfortunately for them they turn out to be far better at what they did than they thought they'd be and reanimate the dead who trap them in a small cottage on the island . Before the reanimation takes place though , Alan seems to take a decidedly unhealthy liking to a dug-up corpse named Orville , who he decides they need to bring back to the cottage with them for a little ' mumbo-jumbo ' and disrespect for the dead . Little does he understand what a poor choice he's made . This is at times funny but I wouldn't call it a horror comedy . Some of the dialog is pretty snappy as the actors and actresses snipe at each other , and there's two gay ghouls ( Roy and Emerson ) to add a bit of comic relief too . They of course were " planted " by Alan before the others arrived to scare the hell out of at least one of the newcomers . When the living dead rise the gang is trapped in the cottage and this becomes fairly standard " Night of the Living Dead " stuff but that's fine , it's not like that's a bad movie and doesn't make this one . Overall it's the look and the atmosphere that makes this one , creepy and eerie with a sense of impending doom . A classic in its own right . .
578039	1399158	36341	8.0	THE SEVENTH VICTIM ( Mark Robson , 1943 )	This had been one of the most elusive of Lewton's classic horror films and , in fact , I only first caught up with it a couple of years ago on Italian TV ( where it was dubbed , of course ) . While I recall being very impressed with it then I only rated it a and , given that I boosted the rating now , one would naturally assume that I loved it even more ; however , the film's low-key nature doesn't make it ideal viewing after a long day's work - but , then , Steve Haberman's excellent Audio Commentary proved quite enlightening ( pointing out some of the subtleties I might have missed ) so that , by the time I was done with the DVD , I felt that I had ' got ' it sufficiently to merit that extra half a star ! As with the first three entries ( after which a change of director was ordered by RKO - but , then , he had to fight for first-timer Mark Robson ! ) , the film basically revolves around a number of highly-charged and brilliantly-handled suspense sequences : the walk down the dark corridor of the cosmetics shop ( the firm is pretentiously named " La Sagesse " , meaning Wisdom ) where an opportunistic but sympathetic pint-sized detective meets his doom ; a Hitchcockian scene aboard a train ; the shower sequence in which a member of the devil cult bursts in on lead Kim Hunter , warning her not to get involved any further ( though entirely different in development , this could well be the cinematic fore-runner of the legendary scene in PSYCHO [ 1960 ] ! ) ; yet another walk across a dark alley with a threat to one of the characters which could come at any moment and from any corner . The film is undercast , but effectively so : Kim Hunter is impressive in her debut performance ; her two suitors , however , are rather too fey - though the poet character is , at least , intriguing ( if giving rise to a decidedly over-literate script , already peppered with Lewton's typically pretentious quotations ! ) ; Tom Conway actually reprises his role from CAT PEOPLE ( 1942 ) , making it one of cinema's first examples of a prequel - since his character died in the earlier movie ! ; Jean Brooks - writer / director Richard Brooks ' wife - was a somewhat vapid heroine in THE LEOPARD MAN ( 1943 ) , but this quality ( accentuated by her dark wig , which is every bit as iconic as the one sported by Louise Brooks in PANDORA'S BOX [ 1928 ] and must have inspired Uma Thurman's look in Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION [ 1994 ] ) actually fitted like a glove her enigmatic and nihilistic character here ! Even though the latter does not make an appearance before the 30-minute mark of this 71-minute film - and she only has about 10 minutes of actual screen-time in all ! - her presence permeates the entire movie , much like Orson Welles ' Harry Lime would in THE THIRD MAN ( 1949 ) . Though , at first glance , the devil cult may not seem particularly sinister ( apart from their leader , Ben Bard ) the scene where they finally catch up with Brooks and attempt to induce her to suicide is superbly done ; then again , its depiction of Satanists as normal people who lead normal social lives anticipated ROSEMARY'S BABY ( 1968 ) by a quarter of a century ! The script also manages to sneak in several allusions to lesbianism ( which are there for anyone who cares to pick them up ) ; certainly an unusual emphasis for the time . It also features one of the bleakest endings to any film ( particularly coming from a Hollywood studio product ! ) , featuring yet another brief but haunting turn from Elizabeth Russell as a dying woman ; even though I was aware of how it was all going to end , it still took my breath away ( the closing lines - from a sonnet by John Donne - are unforgettable and among the greatest ever , in my opinion ) ! The Audio Commentary ( perhaps the finest in this Box Set ) goes into some detail about deleted footage that expanded on the interesting relationship in the film between Conway and the young poet , and also between Conway and a one-armed member of the cult ( whose role is severely diminished in the final film ! ) ; as a matter of fact , Conway's motives here are even more obscure than in CAT PEOPLE : he's seen as a prominent figure at the parties given by the devil-worshippers , and yet it's because Brooks spilled the beans to him that the latter want her dead ( he , meanwhile , seems intent on harboring her despite his cynical veneer ) ! Haberman also mentions the efforts of British film-makers to watch THE SEVENTH VICTIM in wartime ( American films of this era only reached foreign shores after the end of WWII ! ) - among them the Boulting Brothers , Carol Reed and Michael Powell ( the last , according to DVD Savant but which I can well believe , since Kim Hunter was cast in the added subplot for the alternate U . S . version of The Archers ' A CANTERBURY TALE [ 1944 ] ! ) - and a hilarious anecdote of scenarist De Witt Bodeen ( the script was co-written with Charles O'Neal , father of actor Ryan ! ) attending a real devil-worship meeting in which harmless-looking old ladies cast terrible spells on Hitler while nonchalantly sipping tea ! ! The theory of doubles he comes up with is interesting , too , if one I hadn't actually picked on myself ; regrettably , however , the Commentary omits biographical data for cast and crew members , which is usually thorough for even the minor characters ( as I would have liked to know more , for instance , about the actors who memorably played the ill-fated detective and an old newspaper woman - despite their limited screen-time ) .
579334	583640	53211	7.0	Nice idea , but the sum is less than its parts .	This is an enjoyable enough short , but with the idea they start with , narration by June Foray and this being a Pepe Le Pew , somehow this one sort of stumbles and lurches along . It may just be me , but the jokes aren't that funny and the dialogue is lame for some reason . The base idea is very inventive , but the story seems forced . Not a bad cartoon by any means . Just not all that good either . Still worth watching at least once . Recommended for big Pepe Le Pew fans .
486662	386241	74740	6.0	Nothing you haven't seen before .	Franco Nero essentially reprises his role from " Django " , playing yet again a shaggy loner who is the fastest gun in the West and almost singlehandedly fights and destroys an entire gang of crooks . However , what was fairly fresh in 1966 , is no longer fresh in 1976 . The movie is too self-conscious about its own style , too derivative . You can only milk the " strong man of few words " cow so many times . It does have some interesting , unusual flashbacks , though , and beautiful widescreen cinematography . ( )
428422	3079504	29989	4.0	Exploitation " classic " is more silly than shocking	Exploitation classic thats more humorous now then either titillating or shocking . This is an anti-child bride film . Yes there was a time when young , even preteen girls could get married to older men . This is the story of a young girl who may be doomed to suffer such a fate . A serious subject , the film is now very silly with some acting styles that went out of style in the early days of silents ( Watch the scene when Jennie gets up in the morning and try not to fall on the floor laughing . ) Give the film points for having some realer characters than many backwoods films coming from Hollywood , but take a few away since this film is really just an exploitation film . Notorious for a brief flash of nudity in a skinny dipping scene by the then 12 year old star ( some prints excise it ) its nothing even remotely titillating or sexy . Its actually done in such away as to be fleeting and not even clear . I probably shouldn't have even mentioned it except some people are shocked or horrified by it . The film itself is better than it should be , however its still not very good . As I said much of it plays more humorous than serious and its so creaky that you can see the machine like plot clacking away towards its conclusion where you end up on the edge of your seat waiting to see if Jennie will suffer a fate worse then death . ( Its much less over the top than say a film like Reefer Madness where you can laugh at it , which takes away much of the fun ) If you're a fan of creaky exploitation films give it a try . All others stay away .

510769	453068	121802	9.0	ingenious little short , like a newspaper comic strip with sharp wit	Thank You Mask Man is featured as a bonus on the DVD of the Lenny Bruce performance film , and I was very glad I watched it . It reminded me of what I saw once in a Carlin special from the 80s where he put in little animated bits that all visualized his bits . That this comes more than a few years before that is impressive , but more so that it actually works to fit the riff-style comedy that Bruce excelled at . This is basically drawn like , well , basics - the comic-strip characters could've been taken out of any newspaper or other , and it's all crude to the point of not having to focus as much on it . Perhaps most of the strengths , aside from the curious , off-kilter nature of the drawings , do spring out of the material , as a story of a bunch of people having to deal with a ' masked man ' on a horse . It happens to be a good Bruce bit on its own , but then the curious thing does happen that towards the end of the film - when the townspeople then all taunt Masked Man to be gay - the comedy and the look of the film do totally gel somehow . That Bruce is also behind a good part of the style of the picture himself probably explains how some of the same inspired dementia in this story in particular ( one with an absurdity to it but also some truth sprinkled around ) merges with simplistically weird animation . It's probably not one of my favorites ever , to be sure , but I had a lot of fun watching it , as a crazy little anecdote given life and still kicking more than forty years later .
405916	2020269	24787	3.0	Paltry but clever 30's thriller	Most of these 30's thrillers / murder mysteries have been forgotten by now because , let's face it , they haven't got much to offer apart from ? occasionally ? a good story . This little film has a very decent story , fluently written dialogues and some really adequate acting performances , yet it simple can't be called memorable because of the shabbiness of the production . Pat O'Brien ( " Hell's House " ) stars as an obtrusive reporter investigating the vicious assassination of a befriended District Attorney and unravels almost single-handedly an entire network of corruption , blackmail and political scandals . His performance is very good and he gets to say some very slick lines , yet the movie lacks a lot of action and continuity . There's one sequence near the beginning that I found particularly smart , showing how the assignment for murder is passed on to several involved parties and thus creating a complex structure that sadly never gets properly clarified . There are some more ingenious and dared ideas in the plot , but it all looks too poor for you to care . Feel free to avoid this one .
544517	562732	98068	7.0	Not nearly as bad as you would think .	I worked in a video store a few years ago , and in 1998 and 1999 I was on this serious horror movie kick . I would rent them constantly and pretty much whenever a horror movie would go on sale at the store I would buy it . Parents was one of the more obscure horror movies that went on sale ( keep in mind that , in general , the reason they would go on sale would be because they hadn't been rented out in more than a year , so these were unpopular from the outset ) , and it fell into the unfortunate category of being one of the horror movies that I bought when I was in my horror movie kick and then didn't get to before it ended . Hence , I have owned it for almost four years and didn't watch it until yesterday . I would like to start off by commending the cover designer for making this one of the least appealing box covers that I have ever seen ( this may have been a significant factor in the reason that the movie didn't rent out for more than a year ) . But despite the startling cheesiness of the cover box , this is not an entirely incompetent horror film . I have a feeling that at least part of the movie's descent into obscurity may be a result of the fact that it is not at all original and , perhaps more importantly , Randy Quaid went on to a much bigger career in a completely different genre . Unfortunately , one of the movie's biggest strengths is the creepiness that it maintains throughout , which is sadly something that is almost plagiarized from The Shining . It's interesting to consider the similarities between this film and The Shining , and although the latter movie obviously owns the rights to the stolid man and wife with the single creepy son , Parents is far from a failure . I would go as far as to say that , even though the movie borrowed heavily from previous movies , it is able to stand on its own because of its strengths , so I would call the material it borrowed more of an homage than stealing or anything like that . The movie has a lot to say about suburban America in the 1950's , especially with the cute little tract housing and the white picket fence and the American Dream . Everyone wants a nice little house and a front yard and an obedient little kid who does good in school and a nice marriage , a good job , etc . What Parents does is to take that formula and show how much sick and twisted ( i . e . human ) stuff could be going on under the surface without anyone ever realizing it . Humans are animals , which is one of the primary things that 1950's suburban America wanted to hide . ( spoilers ) Where the movie crosses the line ( and thus turns into a horror film ) is when it presents a family that not only is a family of sinners , but cannibals . Bryan Madorsky delivers a startling performance as Michael , the son of Nick and Lily Lamele , a husband and wife with some questionable culinary interests , to say the least . Michael is a quiet and obviously disturbed boy ( for obvious reasons ) and the drama of the film really begins when he begins to question what exactly the ' leftovers ' were before they were leftovers . His parents give him this vague answer ( ' They were . soon to BE leftovers . ' ) , but we have all seen the cover box , so we already know the answer . Where the movie falters is when the creepiness fails to remain interesting on its own . The interactions that go on in the house are some of the creepiest scenes that I've seen in a movie since , well , since The Shining , but eventually the parents descend to typical horror movie villains ( especially the father ) , who ultimately kill each other in the climax , while the horrified ( or , rather , strangely UN-horrified ) son looks on . Despite the weak ending , however , the movie manages to avoid being more of the cheesy crap that you see in the more obscure areas of the horror sections ( and by the way , being an unrecognizable film in the horror or science fiction section at the video store is like being in video limbo - NO one watches these movies ) . I put the movie in to kill some time between class and work and was surprised at how interesting it is . At the very least , if you're going to write this movie off as being just some cheap horror movie , here's something good that it did - I've always been curious about what human meat would taste like . Now I don't think I ever want to know .
578116	1399158	9887	7.0	Ask Father ( N / A , 1919 )	At long last , I've allotted sizeable time ( which should take up to the very last day of the year ) to check out New Line's massive THE HAROLD LLOYD COMEDY COLLECTION 7-Disc Set ! I started off with this one , which is basically a one-joke short ( albeit only 13 minutes in length ) - a boy's various attempts to meet " the busiest man in town " in order to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage - which frequently has characters being shoved out of the father's office by his burly underling . Lloyd ultimately fails in his quest , but eventually finds true love with the father's secretary ( played by Bebe Daniels ) . It's an enjoyable star vehicle which , among other things , sees Lloyd in drag ; bafflingly , there's no director credit attached to this one !
433918	2171244	75406	7.0	Shame on US	Despite the fact that this film had three Oscar nominations , and several Golden Globe nominations with one win ( Katharine Ross ) , and a boatload of stars , it is not worth watching so much for it's quality ( marginal ) but for the story of how we knew what was happening to the Jews before World War II and did little to stop it . This is the story of 937 Jews that were put on a boat to Havana with useless documents , as the German government had no intention of letting them off the ship . They were denied entry into Cuba , and the US also denied them entry before they finally were saved by a social service agency and allowed to land in Belgium . Of course , that would prove ultimately fatal for two-thirds of them as the war started just two months later . Why would Germany do this ? Simple . By sending a ship of Jews to the America's and having them turned away , they negated any right the US would have to complain when they started exterminating Jews . Clever of them , and our government fell right into their trap . Our support for Israel is not so much that we love the Jews , but a massive guilt for our participation in their extermination . There were some great performances in this otherwise mediocre film : Lee Grant and Katherine Ross ; some good performances : Ben Gazzara , Faye Dunaway ; and the film debut of Jonathan Pryce ( POTC 1 . 2 . & 3 , Tomorrow Never Dies ) . Check it out .

As a die-hard Steven Spielberg fan , I find it difficult to give such a tremendously powerful film like Saving Private Ryan anything less than a 10 , but there were a couple of things in the film that caused huge problems for me , mainly because they could have been avoided so easily . For example , whose brilliant idea was it to cast a teenage heartthrob like Matt Damon ( and yes , I realize that he is not a teen himself , but he is extremely popular among junior high school girls ) in the role of a private in a World War II film ? ! Tom Hanks was perfect , but only because he is one of the best actors working right now , and he can do a great job in virtually any role . Furthermore , Ted Danson literally stops the film in its tracks . However , Saving Private Ryan , despite these superficial problems , is a truly timeless film , and is an extremely powerful depiction of the brutality of World War II . Besides being hugely entertaining , a lot can be learned from this film . It is a landmark in filmmaking history and should not be missed .
421607	2542703	50383	9.0	Fear Strikes Out Hits Home Run	Outstanding biography detailing the life of Boston Red Sox slugger Jimmy Piersall . The late Anthony Perkins depicted the appropriate temperament in his portrayal of this baseball legend . Driven by a domineering , obsessed with perfection father , Perkins is outstanding in his portrayal . He is equally matched by Carl Malden , terrific as the father . From childhood Perkins is seen as being driven by his father to achieve perfection . Nothing less will satisfy the compulsive driven father . The scene where Perkins goes berserk during a game is memorable . His recovery is well staged as well . My diagnosis would have been to keep his father away but to make sure that the viewers see this wonderful film .
409328	2567136	58453	5.0	Selling The Sizzle , Not The Steak	Even if you haven't seen the ( until recently ) elusive La Fete Henriette from which George Axelrod ripped off his screenplay this is still pretty dire . There's nothing wrong with the basic premise - it did , after all , produce a masterpiece as written by Henri Jeanson and directed by Julien Duvivier - and nothing wrong with either Audrey Hepburn or William Holden , the problem starts when you get Hepburn and Holden to agree to star in an inept Hollywood remake of a French classic . Think about it : Hepburn plus Holden plus Paris how can it go wrong . Let me count the ways . On second thoughts don't , we'd be here all day . Suffice it to say Audrey looks as gorgeous as she ever did , Holden is as charming as he ever was but somewhere along the way . . .
464368	2467618	854122	9.0	How exactly did IMDb come up with a weighted average of 3 . 7 for this superb short film ?	I was surprised when I looked at the weighted average for COLLAPSED on IMDb . It is listed at 3 . 7 but when I looked at the voting history , twelve people scored it a 10 and only two scored it a 1 and there were not votes in between . How this balances out to 3 . 7 ( when it seem like it should be close to 9 ) is beyond me . The problem isn't just the bizarre scoring but that such an incredibly low score will give people the impression that this is a bad film - - which it certainly isn't ! The film is done with very little dialog . You are forced to guess , to a degree , what is occurring and why . A man is trying to go about his office job but he looks like an emotional wreck - - almost like he's on the verge of a breakdown . At the same time , he takes out some old pictures and glances through them and you realize that he's upset , at least in part , because of a failed relationship , as he keeps staring at the picture of a lady . However , why this is and the entire back story is uncertain until the final very emotionally stirring moments of the film . The film is expertly crafted , engaging and quite moving . Give this film a try and ignore the low rating .
404824	2020269	180073	8.0	Grade-A perversion story	Despite realized with a large budget , despite featuring eminent names both in front and behind the camera and despite scoring reasonably well at box office , " Quills " is quite a popular movie among the fans of primitive and out-of-the ordinary exploitation movies . This selected group of cinema freaks ( myself included ) usually avoids the big blockbusters , but still took the effort to check out " Quills " and label it as a successful amalgamation between mainstream film-making and cult . This has everything to do with the legendary character of Marquis de Sade , whose notorious writings were ? and still are ? a rich source of inspiration for underground movie makers . Just think the sleazy classics directed by Jess Franco ( " Jusine " and " Eugenie " ) or Pier Paolo Pasolini's hugely controversial classic " Salo , or the 120 days of Sodom " . These are genuine cult gems and , naturally , the avid fans are interested in a full-feature film dedicated to the life of the Marquis . I don't know how accurate Doug Wright's screenplay really is when it comes to details , but it's generally known that Marquis de Sade indeed spent several years locked away inside a mental asylum and indeed he nearly got executed for spreading literature of perverse nature . Unlike I expected , " Quills " doesn't focus on how the Marquis ended up at the Charanton asylum or how he managed to convince the ordinary chambermaid Madeleine to smuggle his sex-laden stories to the outside world for publishing . The film merely revolves on how the Marquis continues to express his perversely wicked imagination even after the hypocritical Dr . Royer-Collard confiscated all of his writing-material . The absolute greatest sequences in " Quills " center on how he thinks up new stories and writes them down on sheets , walls and clothes using basic equipment like chicken bones and even his own blood and faeces . Talk about dedication ! The more his opponents realize this man is impossible to censor , the more unendurable his living conditions at the asylum get . Especially when Dr . Royer-Collard's under aged wife runs away with a young and potent architect , clearly influenced by Marquis de Sade's graphic novel " Justine " , his stay at Charanton turns into a living hell . " Quills " is a fascinating film that surprisingly doesn't hold back on strong sexual content and violence . Listening to Geoffrey Rush's insanely perverted imagination , you often get the impression you're actually watching a sleazy and exploitative 70's gem , but with the masterful set-designs and costumes of a fancy Hollywood film . Speak of the devil ; Rush obviously enjoyed depicting the Marquis and literally his every grimace and monologue is performed with diabolical delight . Michael Caine , in a rather unusual role , is perfect as the ill-tempered ' curer of evil ' , hypocritically hiding himself behind a veil of religion and political protection . Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix are adequate performers but rather miscast in their roles of well-meaning supporters of artistic freedom . And , last but not least , another reason for horror fanatics to check out " Quills " is that it features numerous gruesome images of severed heads , attempted rape , cold & uncanny interior shots of a Napoleonic asylum and naughty young girls .

Can she succeed , and what about her own makeover ? Sabotage is everywhere , plus it's hard to be one's self . . . another easy movie to watch from Happy Madison productions , which gets an extra boost from its star faris . another fish out of water comedy which has become well known with the producers , The House Bunny isn't likely to offend anyone , and doesn't really rely on cheap gags ( think farts ) to get the crowd in . it's bright and breezy enough to raise a few smiles during its running time and the ZAZ girls are likable and quirky enough to make you root for their victory . Faris steals the show though and once again proves that she is likable and talented enough to carry a movie on her own . this won't make any dent on the comedy genre as it offers nothing really new , but to brighten up a dreary day , you could do a lot worse . very easy on the eye .
478217	463200	151568	8.0	Long but great	OK , it's too long ( almost 3 hours ) and we did not need all those full performances of numbers from " The Mikado " . That aside , this is an entertaining and extremely well-acted movie about Gilbert & Sullivan - - their personal lives , their working partnership and how " The Mikado " was developed . We also get to see how they train the actors in how to talk , sing and ( in an uproarious sequence ) walk Japanese . How factual this is , I have no idea . But the movie was so well-done and entertaining , who cares . Well worth watching , but you do have to sit through one too many opera numbers .

Racketeer Walter Long ( a great Laurel & Hardy foil ) needs players who can be bought for a fixed game he’s organizing . His moll ( a young Lucille Ball ) and her companions meet The Stooges dressed in football gear – the boys are down on their luck , so they accept a job advertising for a football team – and , mistaking them for star players , bring them home . After the initial misconception about the men’s presence in Long’s apartment – leading to a delightful chase involving a base-less dumb waiter – The Stooges find themselves in a football stadium trying to make head or tails of the game , to the chagrin of the sinister-looking gangster ! The short’s football craziness and the hijinks in the apartment are clearly inspired by HORSE FEATHERS ( 1932 ) , one of The Marx Bros . ’ greatest vehicles .
365216	4888011	32976	10.0	Hitch comes to Hollywood	Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie won Best Picture and Cinematography ( unfortunately , he didn't take home a Best Director Oscar ) . " Rebecca " portrays widower Max de Winter ( Laurence Olivier ) and an unnamed woman ( Joan Fontaine ) getting married . But on their honeymoon , she discovers that the memory of Max's first wife is apparently haunting him in multiple ways . And servant Mrs . Danvers ( Judith Anderson ) isn't exactly what she seems . The possible common Hitchcock theme that one can see in this movie is the murderous gays : there's the possibility that Mrs . Danvers is a lesbian . I don't know whether or not Hitch was a homophobe , but one can see the theme . Either way , " Rebecca " remains a classic .
515295	317399	84881	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Space Pirate Captain Harlock : Arcadia of My Youth ( Waga Seishun No Arukyadia )	The second movie for the festival is another anime , albeit an older one , belonging to the 80s . I vaguely remember watching the series on television as I recall the familiarity of the pirate motif spaceship . But maybe I remembered wrong , as there are plenty of such space aged cartoons in those days , like Macross , Gundam , and the likes . The introduction already put me off , with a really repetitive Phantom Harlock flying his red biplane and monotonous introduction of his name , over and over again . The plot takes some getting used to , with the bombastic names as we follow this rogue pilot / pirate in his quest to duel with Commander Zeda of the Illmidus alien race . Watching this early 80s animation brings about the obvious comparisons and observation of how advanced animated movies have become . It's obviously 2-D drawings here , and plenty of details which were not possible to be included . Things like background characters having continuity presence issues ( varying numbers amongst a crowd in a constant setting ) , and objects appearing and disappearing for the same reason that drawing by hand , takes up time , and yet draws attention to themselves . And having to draw many , well , sometimes animators do become lazy . This is most unlike today's computer generated graphics where crowd and objects are rendered with a click of the button , and possibly given some artificial intelligence along the way so that they can seem to " act " independently . Space battles have become a dime a dozen , and watching this film today , sadly , the battles are not as exciting as it should have been , with its numerous laser cannon scenes . Some scenes were repeated by showing stock clips over and over again , and brings back fond memories of how , as a kid , you tend to see past these shortcomings , and enjoy the animation for what it is . In today's standards , this will be judged more like stemming from the indifference from the animators , and the lack of pride and professionalism . The characters here are typical of Japanese anime , with weird coloured hairdos , and quite surprisingly , this movie loads up on the melodramatics and exaggerated dialogue . Compared with anime of today , there has been vast improvement in story pacing , setting , and character design . While there were families and kids watching Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children , and this one , it wasn't unexpected that this anime too had its fair share of walk outs , probably because of the hard-to-grasp storyline for toddlers , or the insane need to read subtitles and then explaining to the kids what some of the imaginary words meant . P . S . somehow the screening was marred by the speakers set to maximum volume . The dialogue and musical fanfare just got drilled through your ears into your head and probably gave everyone a splitting headache watching it . The first boo-boo for the festival , and I really hope it's the last .
402576	453228	829062	8.0	A good show	Every body loves a Clown is a good show for starting the second season . The show introduces new characters , while the Dean and Sam characters develop , and the clown itself is a great bad guy . The new characters add new life to the series . Jo and Dean have a sexual tension which is obvious . Jo is not over taken by Dean's demeanor ! Ash adds comic relief with line's like being the serious up front party in the back comment . Bobby and the mother is the new anchor to replace John . The Sam and Dean conflict is great which shows that Sam is a little smarter than Dean . Dean's super cool behaviour is killing him . Believe me shock and pain will get to you , I am a lot like Dean , and Dean breaks with his behavior towards the Impala . Dean still has his defensive wit with the I feel like a soccer mom with the mini-van to replace the car . I really hated the evil clown , we all know a evil clown was going to hit the show one day , and I enjoyed the clown getting it . Winchester Boys are about 10 or 11 and 1 in the win column . I believe the Trickster is the only one to beat them . .
551774	989035	88044	5.0	Sick ! Stupid ! . . . but I certainly wasn't bored	Call " Savage Streets " what it is : trash . However , it is amusing , lowest-of-all-levels trash , and I enjoyed Linda Blair's upfront , colorful performance as the vengeful big sister of a rape victim . The dialogue is hilariously vulgar and self-conscious , and the girls ' locker room sequence ( filled with naked babes - - as if this were a women-in-prison flick ) provides just about the final word in exploitive cat fight scenes . The tone wavers from campy juvenalia to psychotic melodrama , and the extreme violence ( as well as the rape scene ) is tough to stomach . However , the film's goal is to be cartoonish junk , and that is surely realized . from
508177	453068	893382	10.0	aka : ' Some Country for Old Men '	Shine a Light displays , thrillingly and with the bombastic POP of a revisited ' happy place ' , why many love the Rolling Stones and many love the style of Martin Scorsese . It's mostly a concert movie shot over a period of two mights at the Beacon theater ( as if doing a workhorse revival of thirty years ago , while Scorsese was busy shooting New York , New York in 76 and doing the Last Waltz concurrently , this time he shot the concert while finishing up the Departed ) , with some choice documentary footage interspersed in between some songs . On both fronts , however minor the ( all archival ) interview footage is , it's a big success , visually and musically , as good old rock and roll performance art ( well , almost art , but I like it ) , and as visual virtuosity made incarnate . It might be easy to adulate the Stones , as well as Scorsese . They've been around for so long , doing what they do , with each side rumored here and there to quit doing what they do ( for the Stones it's every tour , much to their grinning bemusement , and for Scorsese it was a point in the 80s when he thought he'd have to leave Hollywood and make documentaries on saints ) . They're always acclaimed , usually big money-makers , and they've acquired a kind of nether-region between ' cult ' audience and full-blown mainstream mayhem . It's this that is , in a way , the subtext for Shine a Light . While Scorsese stays mostly behind the scenes , the Stones are up and front and in center of a marvelous performance , and showcasing the energy and level of pizazz that quiets the naysayers . They sold out , and it doesn't get to them a single bit . After some funny early footage of Scorsese ( shot usually in black and white DV by Albert Maysles , who also appears here and there ) getting into a minor tizzy about what the set-list is going to be , and getting some downtime with Bill Clinton , the show starts up like any good Stones show should - Jumpin ' Jack Flash . Then onward come some given numbers ( Shattered , Brown Sugar , Tumbling Dice ) , the masterpieces ( Sympathy for the Devil , Loving Cup , featuring an awesome Jack White , and Champagne and Reefer with an equally awesome Buddy Guy ) , and a lot of unexpected tracks too ( Live with Me with showy Aguilera , As Tears go By , some country song , and a kick-ass She Was Hot ) . For fans it's an amazing mix , and it allows for those who are just casual admirers to get their money's worth , primarily in IMAX . This is not just because of the quality of the music and the performances - which is , at its best , revelatory of what this band can do , at any age - but because of Scorsese's cameras , moving around in epic and roving fashion , edited with efficiency to not go all over the place or too slow , and , chiefly , to make it intimate like how many remember the Last Waltz to be ( lots of neatly defined close-ups , lingering on to capture these hardened rockers ) . And at the end , what is the point ? Is it just another blah-blah Stones concert movie ? Not necessarily . It doesn't have the heavy sociological context of Gimme Shelter , however it's not a little sloppy like Let's Spend the Night Together . Shine a Light celebrates its heroes , but it doesn't go completely overboard . Scorsese knows , as he did with Bob Dylan , not to get too cocky with these fogies . It's important to throw in those bits with the Stones getting interviewed , candid and without much overbearing ego present , and by the end you know there's still a place for them , firmly , in the public consciousness . They sold out in the most ironically good way in rock music history , with Scorsese now wonderfully in tow .
405917	2020269	365677	3.0	The umpteenth bad shark movie	What's with all these stupid but fancy looking made-for-TV shark movies these days ? Only a couple weeks ago , I watched something awful called " Spring Break Shark Attack " in which a troop of sharks eat some college bikinis , and here's another one already , this time set in the swamps and revolving on a bull shark . Well , at least " Red Water " is slightly better than the aforementioned " Spring Break " but of course still a long way from being a good shark-thriller . Two crews of people navigate their boats down the extensive swamps of Louisiana . One crew ( with Kirsty Swanson and Lou Diamond Philips on board ) is on their way to drill oil , the other crew are villains ( with rapper Coolio among them ) looking for a lost treasure on the bottom of a lake , but all they encounter is an extremely hungry bull shark . It's rather dangerous to swim with him around , so the bad guys take the good guys ( and girl ) hostage and command them to dive for the money . " Red Water " features one or two well-staged action sequences and the bull shark is an interesting choice of water monster ( finally something different than the Great White or Tiger Shark ) , but overall it's a forgettable thriller with weak performances from a washed up cast . There's no tension , a minimum of bloodshed and the underwater footage only shows brief images of a fake computer-engineered shark . The lovely Mrs . Swanson doesn't even wear on a colorful bikini , for Christ's sake , so why are we still talking about it ?

Tom can't seem to catch a break-he not only has Jerry to chase ( difficult in and of itself , as witness his monumental failure rate ) , but a little yellow bird sticks his beak in matters at the most inopportune ( for Tom ) moments .

Save the congratulations for a safer time and place . Most entertaining and executed short from when Tom and Jerry were definitely in flower . Well worth watching and most highly recommended .
393935	2483625	25830	4.0	The Unmasked Lone Ranger	Sad to say this is one of the sillier of John Wayne's series of poverty row westerns for Lone Star Productions . Here he is a United States Marshal on the trail of a bandit known only , I kid you not , as the Shadow . No it's not Lamont Cranston , it's some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don't see who he is . But the voice is unmistakable , you'll know within 10 minutes of the film . And another reviewer here is quite wrong , no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because Gabby Hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he's clean shaven here . He had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the Duke . Later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so I'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was . I don't think those that wrote this one knew either . Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked Lone Ranger and Tonto . It's all pretty silly if you ask me .
428550	3079504	991169	6.0	Good but not great look at the making of a New York Noir gem .	Expansion of a 1990 documentary about the making of Blast of Silence , a late in the game film noir thriller that was filmed on the streets of New York City to great effect . The original version was made after the film was rediscovered at a German film festival and a TV film crew went and followed director and star Allen Baron around the films locations while he talked about the film . This expansion includes that footage as well as 2006 interview with Baron . This is a good but not great look at the making of the film as well as the career of Baron . The problem is that the stories that Baron tells seem to be almost random and often spiral out in odd directions , for example he talks a great deal about a closed restaurant and how its was important to the New York theater community . Its not bad , its just not on point . When Baron is on point the stories are great . The film is also great in the way that it shows how the city has changed over the thirty years between when the film was made and Baron revisits the locations . ( I should also mention that on the Criterion DVD of Blast of Silence , where this film is included as an extra , there is also a series of stills that brings the changes of the locations up to 2008 . ) Baron also muses a great deal about the psychology of his character from the film . I'm not sure that its all that necessary since much of it seems pretty clear in the film itself . Overall I liked this look at the making of Blast , but I didn't love it . Its too unfocused to be wholly satisfying . Still I did enjoy the hour I spent watching it but I don't know if I would watch it again , not because its bad but I don't think I'd get much out of a second viewing . Worth a look if you've seen Blast of Silence . If you haven't seen Blast then don't even consider watching this partly because its full of spoilers but mostly what is discussed will mean nothing to you unless you've seen the film its about .
479107	463200	131704	9.0	Really silly and very funny !	I was surprised at how much I liked this movie ! The basic plot has Boris , Natasha and Fearless Leader becomig humans and trying to take over the world through really bad TV . Rocky and Bullwinkle and an FBI agent try to stop them . Basically it's a bunch of bad jokes and adult references flying fast and furious ( just like the TV show ) . The thing is the movie KNOWS the jokes are bad and acknowledges it constantly - - and it's always funny ! The jokes are nonstop and were so knowingly dumb that I couldn't stop laughing . . . you're laughing WITH the movie not AT it ! The only real drawback was making Boris , Natasha and Fearless Leader humans . Jason Alexander , Rene Russo and Robert DeNiro are good actors . . . but not here . They LOOK the parts but they're portraying two-demensional characters ( in every respect ) and have NOTHING to work with . Other than that this is a very funny , very silly movie . . . SEE IT !

Joe Morse , ( John Garfield ) is a crooked lawyer who is involved with big time gangsters and gives them all kinds of legal advice concerning their criminal activities . Leo Morse , ( Thomas Gomez ) is a brother of Joe and they both do not get along very well mainly because Joe went to college and made a big name for himself and Leo was just a simple numbers manager . Edna Tucker , ( Marie Windsor ) works for Leo Morse and is a very young gal and she gets romantically involved with Joe Morse which adds some female sparks to this film . Great acting by veteran actor Thomas Gomez and John Garfield gave an outstanding performance . This is a very well directed film and it will hold your interest from beginning to the very end .
366553	3109237	110018	3.0	The weakest of the five	- In the final Hercules made-for-television movie , Hercules is called upon to save a village from a Minotaur . But things are not as simple as they seem . The Minotaur has a secret that Hercules must overcome if he is to save himself and the village . - This is easily the weakest of the five movies that preceded the television series . Half of the running time is filled with flashbacks from the four previous movies . It gets old real quick . The actual battle with the Minotaur is a disappointment as well . The costume worn by the actor playing the Minotaur makes it all but impossible for him to move with any grace during the fight scenes . The relationship between Hercules and Iolaus , which would become one of the highlights of the television series , seems very unnatural . Almost all of the dialogue is designed to set up the next flashback . - Too bad , because this one has a lot of potential . The plot concerning the Minotaur's secret is one of the best in the five movies . Although the way it is handled makes it very obvious for anyone to guess .
453553	15896852	4972	9.0	The Unfortunate Birth of a Clan	As the film itself states , " This is a depiction of the events of the civil war and of the formation of the Ku Klux Klan from the point of view of the American South . " Let that be a warning ! Still , expert motion picture making from D . W . Griffith , G . W . Bitzer , and company . This film should receive a perfect " 10 " - - but the aggravating and overt racist theme is sometimes worse than the actual war . The " Negro race " is , if you think about it , blamed for the Civil War - - beginning with the unbalanced opening : " The bringing of the African to America planted the first seed of disunion . " The " Civil War " depicted in " Birth of a Nation " isn't over until the end of Part 2 ; when Confederates band together as the Ku Klux Klan , and defeat the " Negroes " . In this film , the KKK wins . Part 1 , by the way , is somewhat more tolerable - - but , by the end of Part 2 , the film's message becomes obvious . Note that Jesus Christ makes a God-blessed-this-film appearance . Otherwise , Lillian Gish ( as Elsie Stoneman ) and Henry B . Walthall ( as Ben Cameron ) are extraordinary in the lead roles ; she represents the North , and he represents the South . The Stomeman and Cameron families ' friendship and conflicts , due to the war , would have been a good , singular film focus . Of course , Mr . Walthall's character is a racist hero , but he performs the role exceptionally well . Ms . Gish is at her silent best ; don't miss the scene where , after a date with Walthall , she caresses her bedpost ! Second leads Elmer Clifton ( as Phil Stoneman ) and " daughter of the south " Miriam Cooper ( as Margaret Cameron ) hold their own against the powerful Gish and Walthall . Ms . Cooper has eyes which seem slightly askew in some shots , giving her an eerie quality . Josephine Crowell ( as Mrs . Cameron ) shines , among the more mature performers . Mae Marsh and Violet Wilkey ( both as Flora Cameron ) are quite memorable , also . In a supporting role , Robert Harron ( as Tod Stoneman ) is at Gish-level acting ; don't miss the scene with Harron embracing George Beranger ( as Wade Cameron ) when the " chums " expire on the battleground . Harron makes the scene especially touching . Note that Harron appears later on , in an unexpected role . Joseph Henabery is another appearing in different roles ; he is most memorable as Abraham Lincoln ; the assassination sequence is another film highlight , with Raoul Walsh ( as John Wilkes Booth ) . Harron and Ms . Marsh would be even more dazzling in Griffith's next , " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) . Another great scene occurs when Walthall walks unsteadily out of the hospital with Gish , while guard William Freeman gives Gish a last longing sigh . And , it's easy to see why Wallace Reid ( as a blacksmith ) ' s search for Walter Long ( as Gus ) , in " Joe's ginmill " , was a star-making brawl . The Birth of a Nation ( / 15 ) D . W . Griffith - Lillian Gish , Henry B . Walthall , Mae Marsh , Robert Harron
574399	4532636	86005	7.0	Hated It as a Kid ; Think I Would Like It as an Adult	I've only seen " Never Cry Wolf " once , during its original theatrical run . I was eight years old then and was completely bored by this film . I have a feeling that I would love it now for all of the reasons that I hated it then . Those reasons are the fact that it takes place in the Alaskan wilderness and is full of stunning visuals of the terrain and wildlife . And , it's a movie told largely without dialogue and spends large parts of its running time with one lone character . I'm fascinated by movies like that now , and so think it's worth giving " Never Cry Wolf " another try .
576643	1399158	48993	7.0	BEATRICE CENCI ( Riccardo Freda , 1956 )	There've been many cinematic versions of the famous medieval tale ; most notable were the ones directed by two " Euro Cult " masters , this by Freda and Lucio Fulci's 1969 film . Besides , Bertrand Tavernier's LA PASSION BEATRICE ( 1987 ) was inspired by Freda's take - Tavernier being an admirer and personal friend of the Italian film-maker . The title role is played by Mireille Granelli , whose film career didn't prove very prolific - though she does well enough here . The plot involves a girl's mistreatment at the hands of her tyrannical father - feared and hated by all and , again , played by Gino Cervi ( from THE IRON CROWN [ 1941 ] ) ; eventually accused and tortured as an accomplice in his murder , she ends up beheaded for refusing to divulge the whereabouts of her lover ( Fausto Tozzi ) . Besides , the father is incestuously drawn to his daughter , and there's a similar relationship going on between his weakling son ( latter-day " Euro-Cult " star Anthony Steffen ) and his stepmother ( Micheline Presle ) ! It's not quite as sordid as it sounds - at least not in Freda's film , which I would call the " Hollywood " version of the tale : a lavish melodrama which is almost operatic in treatment and presentation ( Franco Mannino's full-blooded score , the elaborate sets and the vivid color scheme certainly attest to this ) , it's basically the Italian equivalent of the contemporaneous work of Douglas Sirk ! The film also makes full and careful use of the widescreen frame : characters are often positioned on the sides and separated by an object - usually a window - to give the whole a sense of depth . Unfortunately , the ratio in the version I watched has been somewhat compromised because the right side of the frame is evidently cropped during several scenes ; I also experienced a continuous and distracting echo on the soundtrack , not to mention slight picture loss during the crucial final scene ( the ironic aftermath of innocent Beatrice's tragic execution ) . . . I've watched all three films - 1956 , 1969 and 1987 - in pretty close proximity and they're all excellent , but also quite different stylistically : Fulci's , unsurprisingly , is the most visceral ( with considerable attention devoted to the torture scenes - which here are also aimed at the lover , played by Tomas Milian ) but giving vent , too , to the director's much-publicized anti-clericalism ; Tavernier's - concentrating on the psychology of the characters amid a painstaking if distinctly cheerless recreation of the Middle Ages - is , then , clearly the most realistic i . e . least stylized one . P . S . Incidentally , I had intended to precede the film with a viewing of an earlier historical effort by Freda - IL CONTE UGOLINO ( 1949 ) - recorded off late-night Italian TV ; however , during the first couple of minutes , the battered print involved featured so many missing frames - and , consequently , lines of dialogue - that it was impossible to follow . . . and maddening to experience , to say the least ! An impromptu research on the Internet suggested that this unfortunate deficiency was a constant throughout the entire broadcast - so I thought it best to let go for the time being , even if I'll keep the recording and maybe summon enough courage to give it another try somewhere down the line . . .
420653	2542703	32976	10.0	Who are You Rebecca ?	Daphne Du Maurier's great book was turned into a phenomenal Oscar-winning film of 1940 . By chance , a meek , timid girl , Joan Fontaine , meets the elegant Laurence Olivier , a moody individual , haunted by a deep secret . She is at a resort as a companion to the wealthy Florence Bates . Bates is quite effective as a domineering matron who loses Fontaine to the infatuated Olivier . The two marry and go back to the estate of Manderley . She meets the entire staff and is certainly unaccustomed to having things done for her . As head of the staff , Judith Anderson etched an unforgettable eerie character-Mrs . Danvers , who was totally devoted , to Olivier's first wife , Rebecca . The unusual technique of never showing who Rebecca is , is quite effective . We soon learn that Rebecca's death is suspicious . Naturally , we have George Sanders , a cousin to Rebecca , to stir up things as well as plot with Mrs . Danvers . When finally , it appears that Olivier had killed his wife , the truth emerges that even shocks the devoted Danvers . Not able to get her way , Danvers literally turns up the heat and burns down the place in an exciting ending . Though " Rebecca " was voted best picture of the year , nominees Olivier , Fontaine and Anderson ( in a supporting role ) came up short . A clever mystery with great performances . " Rebecca , " even in death , you remain a forever mystery .
483665	1293485	184791	4.0	Uhh . . . was that supposed to be sad at the ending ? Or were we allowed to laugh ? Because I did .	A little advice to the director , STOP WITH THE SOAP OPERA ! ! ! I know that Shakespeare stories are very sad and depressing but for God's sake ! It was so over dramatic . You don't feel for the characters . You think that two of the main characters are asses . And you think that the girl is very insincere . The ending isn't sad , because ( I hate to say this about Josh Hartnett , sorry Josh ! ) but BAD ACTING ! ! ! Even though I'm a fan of Josh Hartnett and saw this movie because he was in it , I just thought this was a bad pick . And maybe O should of concentrated on getting things straight with his girl then getting even . Especially when he hasn't asked other friends and seeing if she was cheating or suspected of it . So , I believe that Shakespeare is not going to be proud . Good luck to Mekhi , Josh , and Julia . Because I know you could do better .
522435	4445210	1009816	5.0	Popeye's ' Submarini ' Sandwich	Overall , despite one funny scene , this was pretty lame and a prime example of how these 1960-61 Popeye editions put out by King Features seemed to be made with five-year-old children as its target audience , certainly not us adults who loved the Popeye cartoons from the 1930s through the 1050s . Popeye is asked to watch the diner while Wimpy leaves to run an errand . That's fine with the sailor man because that means some good eats . He begins by " making my favorite , one of them submarini sandwiches ! " The way he makes his " submarini " is humorous . The sandwich indirectly winds up the " hero " of the story , too ! Brutus comes in the restaurant and forces Popeye - through a physical beating - to accept his jukebox as entertainment instead of the usual organ grinder and monkey , who are dispatched to the refrigerator . Meanwhile , Brutus grabs Olive , who is the cook , and runs off with her . How Popeye rescues her and beats the bully is the rest of the short story .
479379	463200	86637	9.0	Very good but overpraised	Really strange mock documentray that takes place in America in the 1920s - - a man , Leonard Zelig ( Woody Allen ) is a human chameleon - - he takes on the physical characteristics of any man he is with . He's regarded as a freak but a caring doctor named Eudora ( Mia Farrow ) tries to cure him . This came out in 1983 and was a huge hit . With it's truly incredible trick photography ( inserting Allen and Farrow in actual newsreel footage of the 20s ) it was fascinating to watch - - and still is . But critics overpraised it ridiculously . It's a very good little comedy but no masterpiece . Some critics were comparing it to " Citizen Kane " ! As it is it's good but not totally satisfying - - there's just not enough material for a full-length film . Even at its short running time - - 79 minutes - - it feels too long . At about the 50 minute mark it should have ended . When it was over I was still " hungry " for another movie . So , it's worth seeing for its photography and a few hilarious moments , but it's not enough .
363738	4888011	59245	5.0	" Life of Brian " is my favorite biblical epic	Anyone who's read any of my reviews of most musicals and / or epics will most likely know that I only watch them so that I can trash-talk them a la " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . " The Greatest Story Ever Told " would be perfect fodder for that show . Among my heckling remarks were : " Son , when you reign . . . " - " . . . you'll pour . " " All the tribes on the earth . . . " - " . . . she had to come to mine . " " Hosanna ! " - " Oh , Hosanna , don't you cry for me ! We got a new religion and it's gonna set us free ! " Sorry if I offend religious people , but having been raised without religion , I take none seriously ( Bill Maher's documentary " Religulous " pretty much displays my opinion of organized religion , although I think that Maher could have done better ) . As for the characters . First off , it makes no sense to cast white people like Max von Sydow and Claude Rains as biblical figures . The stories took place in the Middle East , so they should have all been at least swarthy ; Sidney Poitier , Jamie Farr and Michael Ansara ( Barbara Eden's then-husband ) were the only cast members who looked accurate . Apparently , when someone asked George Stevens why he cast so many top stars - among them Carroll Baker , Pat Boone , Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall , Dorothy McGuire and John Wayne - in small roles , Stevens asserted that in later years people wouldn't know who these actors / actresses are and would judge the whole movie on its merits . Well , I know who most of these people are / were . One of the things that I judge is that the movie comes across as a lead weight . And that Charlton Heston turns John the Baptist into a real wise guy , and that it's hard to watch Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate and not think of Savalas's other roles . In my opinion , the important thing to understand about Jesus is that he was basically a revolutionary . Judea was a hierarchical society with the colonizing Romans collaborating with the king and the religious institution , and then along comes this carpenter who starts speaking for the masses . The fact that people wanted to free murderer Barrabas goes to show that in a frenzied-up society , a revolutionary is considered more dangerous than a murderer . I actually didn't learn the story of Jesus until my parents and I went to Paris when I was ten . Going to the museums and seeing the paintings depicting biblical scenes , my mom decided that she'd better explain to me what the story was . For the record , by the age of five , I could identify the people behind the Bugs Bunny cartoons ( Mel Blanc , Chuck Jones , Friz Freleng , etc ) . Long story short , I don't recommend this movie , unless it's for a film class . Also starring Michael Anderson , Joanna Dunham , Van Heflin , Martin Landau , David McCallum , Donald Pleasance and Shelley Winters .
394321	2483625	35100	8.0	Giving the British Some Hope	My Favorite Blonde has in the title role Madeleine Carroll a most beautiful blond player , who is a British secret agent trying to get some microfilm about air routes for American planes to go to Great Britain as part of lend lease . But just as her boat is docking in New York , some nasty Nazi spies shoot her male companion . The microfilm is hidden in a pin that she's wearing and with the Nazis hot on her trail . she ducks into a vaudeville house which has Bob Hope and a roller skating penguin on the bill . I'm sure back in the day Hope played in vaudeville with many type acts like these . Vaudeville was moribund in those days and Hope wasn't helping to revive it . In fact he's got to get to Hollywood because some movie company wants to star the penguin in a film . That fits in real nice with Carroll's plans and as it usually goes , the bumbling Mr . Hope is in the clutches of a beautiful who actually falls for old ski nose as he tries to help her when she levels with him . My Favorite Blonde is a fast paced 78 minute film , one of the shortest of Hope's feature films . Carroll looks like she's enjoying spoofing a part she did in Alfred Hitchcock's 39 Steps across the pond . Of course she's the one dragooned into help . But it's Hope's show all the way . My favorite two sequences is both trying to sleep and feed the penguin in an upper on a train and when Hope and Carroll are at an Irish picnic in Chicago . James Burke and Edward Gargan are very funny as a pair of thick headed Irish teamsters . Though My Favorite Blonde is terribly dated with the World War II background the laughs still hold up very well .
422281	2248099	74633	7.0	Well done and funny send-up of B-movie making .	Hollywood Boulevard is Joe Dante's first feature film and it's a send-up of the way that B-movies are made . The film was clearly shot on a budget and much of the runtime is actually spent on showing parts from other movies ! ( The work of Roger Corman in particular , who has a producer's credit ) . In spite of this , the film actually does work really well and that is in no small part thanks to the excellent cult cast and a well written script that features plenty of very well done jokes . The plot follows budding actress Candy Hope who goes off to Hollywood in the hope of making a name for herself . She ends up meeting agent Walter Paisley ( that name should be familiar to many cult fans ! ) who soon manages to get her a part in a film - albeit a part as a stunt girl on a Miracle Pictures film . She soon learns why the studio has the catchphrase " if it's a good film , it's a miracle " as the production is difficult and it's not long before various members of the cast begin being picked off by an unknown assailant ! The cast is one of the strongest things about this film , not least because of the inclusion of Dick Miller in a role much bigger than his usual cameo appearance . We also benefit from the Eating Raoul stars Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov who both stand out in their roles . The film is very short , running at just over eighty minutes , but plenty is packed into that runtime and the film is never boring for a second . I have no idea if making an actual B-movie is like it is portrayed in this film but if the actual B-movies I have seen are anything to go by , it might well be an accurate representation given how unprofessional the characters of the film are . The film is not exactly story heavy and the premise basically just makes up the plot of the film , but the characters help to ensure that the film has some sort of structure . The plot line involving people being murdered does feel a little bit out of place , but the movie is clearly meant just to a fun time so it's really not all that important . Overall , this film is good entertainment and provides some laughs and is well worth a look for any B-movie fan .

371502	2488512	453467	3.0	Flawed and Corny	In Algiers , New Orleans , after the explosion of a ferry transporting the sailors from the USS Nimitz and their families with 543 casualties , the lonely AFT agent Doug Carlin ( Denzel Washington ) is assigned to investigate the terrorist attack . Without any lead , he is informed by Sheriff Reed about a corpse of a woman that was found one hour before the explosion , but burnt with the same explosive . He is invited by FBI Agent Pryzwarra ( Val Kilmer ) to join the surveillance team leaded by Jack McCready ( Bruce Greenwood ) in the investigations , using a time window and Einstein-Rosen bridge through seven satellites to look back four and half days in time . He discloses the identity of the mysterious dead woman called Claire Kuchever ( Paula Patton ) and decides to follow her last moments trying to find the criminal . Along the surveillance , Doug falls in love for Claire and tries to change destiny , saving her life . " Déjà Vu " is a great deception , with a flawed , shallow and corny screenplay . The paradoxical story is full of inconsistencies , but the worst is the ridiculous and incoherent conclusion . I like time travel movies , but the plot of this overrated flick is full of holes . I believe the misleading title " Déjà Vu " refers to the role of Denzel Washington , very similar to many others of his movies . Title ( Brazil ) : " Déjàvu "
487079	386241	65832	3.0	What a goofy film !	Clumsy comedy with cheesy " special effects " ( if you want to call them that ) and a dumb storyline . Still , this could be considered something of a cult item today , because it feautures Arnold Schwarzenegger in his movie debut ; he is already impressive-looking , and his voice is dubbed throughout by a man who sounds nothing like him ! What saves this movie from the lowest possible rating is its lack of pretension ; the people involved in it must have known that they were making a bad movie and didn't try to hide it at all . For example , when Hercules fights a bear , there is no attempt to make the bear look even slightly real ; it's all-too-obviously a man in a bear suit . ( )
543857	562732	93629	4.0	Hey , what ever happened to that music video ?	Unless I'm sadly mistaken , I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video , I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors , at the end of it , and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen . It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now , but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos . There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits , and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes . What could make a rap group look more foolish I can't imagine . ( spoilers ) At any rate , I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version , so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series . The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2 , with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands . Kristen Parker ( Patricia Arquette ) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in , then runs to the bathroom , the sink's handles turn into Freddy's hands and attack her , and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists . From there , the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment . ' Larry ' Fishburne , tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles , was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly , stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little . Not surprisingly , he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie . Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor , but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film . The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists . All of them are cynical and uncooperative , almost none believing that they really belong there at all . Eventually , they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria . Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson , this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger . Not surprisingly , she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients , since she had experienced exactly what they're going through . There are some interesting murders in this installment , and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump . There is a gigantic , worm-like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole , there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV , but there is also an unconvincing go-motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger's skeleton , which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard . And one of the more groan-inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream ( the one famous for sleepwalking ) , tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet . Ouch . We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment . Not only do we meet his mother , but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs . In fighting Freddy , the patients all band together and , in their dreams , use their special powers ( most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life ) to fight him . One student , bound to a wheelchair , is able to walk in his dreams , another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the ' Wizard Master , ' another is ' beautiful and bad ' ( she has lots of makeup , her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk , and she has knives ) . Clever , but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients , the one who can't speak , not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie , when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams ( at just the right moment to save the day ) . His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long , but collectively , now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors . Altogether , this is not an entirely weak entry into the series . The acting is pretty shoddy , but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie . Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast , displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career , and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two ? a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films . The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension , which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil . But then again , not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed , or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives . But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones ?

Sometimes it is in the form of a big trunk . 2 - a collection of wearing apparel ; a collection of stage costumes and accessories I know it as the second definition but in this movie , an early Roman Polanski film , it is a big " dresser , a large piece of furniture to store clothes and has a mirror in the middle of it . It looks big and tough for even two people to carry . So . . . . imagine the absurdity of the opening scene : two men appearing out of the ocean , walking to shore carrying this " wardrobe ! " That scenes sets up this strange 14-minute film , the first one of Polanski's to get public viewing . Polanski made films in Poland for the first five years of his career . I wonder what people there thought of this strange tale . This movie starts out strictly as a comedy , almost like an old silent film one because there is no dialog so all the humor is physical . However , it then delves into some other odd areas , such as animal abuse , some unexplained and non-eventful and very routine scenes with a girl , some fistfights . You just never know what will happen , all the while the two guys are carrying this huge wardrobe around . I left out mentioning a bunch of strange things so as not to spoil it . Like most of Polanski's early works , this is unusual stuff . My opinion is that many people would see this in many ways , and have a wide wide of likes and dislikes about it . One thing for sure : it's different . You can see this early Polanski effort on disc number 2 of the " Knife In The Water " DVD .

484269	1416505	61411	3.0	Peter Cushing versus a giant moth ! Yeah right . . .	Pulp , pulp absolute pulp . The story is just as silly as it sounds . The also didn't bother to explain - or make sense to anything . For a monster movie it also doesn't have enough ' monster ' in it and the story is not tense or mysterious mainly because it's such a complete mess . The story is incredible B-movie like . A scientist has created a creature that can transform back and forth between a giant moth ( what the . . . ? ! ? ) and a young woman . To stay alive , the moth has to feed itself with fresh blood of innocent victims . This is where Peter Cushing comes in . He plays an inspector who is set to investigate this strange and mysterious murders . An awful few is ever happening in this movie . From start till the finish the movie basically isn't heading anywhere and the movie is filled with dull moments that are distracting from the main plot line of the movie . Yes , it really is a movie about nothing . The giant moth creature makes the whole even more ridicules . The moth itself is not back looking but the transformation scene's are laughable bad . Even the transformation sequences in " The Wolf Man " from 1941 were more convincing . The moth also gets very little interesting to do in the movie and is only featured in about 3 very short sequences I believe . The entire movie is also horribly edited together . At times it feels like entire sequences were cut out , or not even filmed . The movie jumps from one sequence to another . At least Peter Cushing seemed to be enjoying himself during filming . Just look at his face during his sequences with Russell Napier and Vanessa Howard . Also Glynn Edwards was somewhat good and enjoyable in his role . Robert Flemyng and Vanessa Howard were however dreadful most of the time . Also look out for Kenneth Colley ( Captain / Admiral Piett from " Star Wars : Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back " and " Star Wars : Episode VI - Return of the Jedi " . ) and a very young David Griffin ( Emmet from " Keeping Up Appearances " . ) in quite a big role . The ending of the movie is also a huge letdown . It's very simple and completely unsatisfying . Perphaps almost even laughable . Guess it's still only a bit good and scary when you are afraid of moths .

Hearing that " unpainted furniture " kingpin Nathan Arizona , Sr . ( Trey Wilson ) has just become father to a set of quintuplets , they figure to take one of the children and raise it as their own . What the heck , he's got more kids than he can handle , right ? " Raising Arizona " is an endearing , loopy , sometimes wild and frenetic oddball movie with entertaining and likable characters . The chase scenes are absolutely breathtaking . Watch them for those incredible camera movements ! The dialog is pretty funny at times , especially as spoken by this eclectic cast , also including John Goodman , William Forsythe , Sam McMurray , Frances McDormand , and Randall " Tex " Cobb as a repugnant motorcycle-riding bounty hunter . M . Emmet Walsh has an amusingly obnoxious cameo as a guy who won't shut up . This does have a little bit of everything : comedy , drama ( yes , this is also a movie with real heart , in spite of the film's generally offbeat approach ) , action , crime , and farce , all blended together to make a satisfying whole by film-making brothers Joel and Ethan Coen , a worthy follow-up to their memorable film noir tribute ( and debut ) , " Blood Simple " . " Raising Arizona " is an enjoyable experience all the way through . Highly recommended . Sadly , co-star Wilson only made a few more films before passing away in 1989 . His rants are among the funniest comedy moments in the film .

His old friend Colin Westmacott has become a guitar-playing hippie who rejoices in the new name of ' Slug ' , and , with his sexy girlfriend ' Fifty-Five ' , plans on going to a commune in Cornwall . He invites Billy to come along . Thinking that a new life of unlimited free love awaits , Billy agrees . But first there's the problem of what to do with his new friends . Billy smuggles Slug into his bedroom , whilst installing ' Fifty-Five ' in his dad's television repair van . Unbeknowest to him , Slug smuggles the girl in through the window . Billy tells his parents he plans on becoming a hippie , and they hit the roof . . . Sooner or later , hippies were bound to turn up in ' Billy Liar ' . ' Slug ' is played by Simon Rouse , better known these days as ' D . C . I . Jack Meadows ' from ' The Bill ' . Its quite a good episode , actually . For the first time , Mr . Fisher is faced with a young man even more rebellious than his son . There's no sense of the hippies being out to con anyone , which was the case in many ' 70's sitcoms to feature them . But then these were largely written by middle-aged men . The source of the humour here is Mr . Fisher's narrow-mindedness . The fact that ' Slug ' refers to his girl by a number is odd . Its the very kind of depersonalisation the hippie movement were dead against . What's even more strange is that ' Fifty-Five ' ( Pam Scotcher ) doesn't seem to mind . Funniest moment - Billy imagining himself as a hippie pop star !
454837	11228318	13149	6.0	The Four Musicians of Bremen is another of Disney's earliest cartoons	According to the IMDb list of Walt Disney's directorial achievements , this was the second earliest animated short he ever made ( the first being Little Red Riding Hood ) . In this Laugh-O-Gram , we see four animals running from bricks being thrown after them by humans . The last of them , a cat , keeps appearing and disappearing at various points in this sequence . They stop at a river where three of them play music while the cat tries to catch a fish that walks out of the river and jumps away each time the cat tries to hit him with a board . I'll stop there and say that was pretty amusing as was a later sequence where some human men shoot cannon balls at the house the four animals are staying with the cat pulling a Felix and using his tail to hit one of those balls from the roof and then riding on another of them ( or was it the same one ?

But be here now . This is 2000 , no longer the thirties . " La ville est tranquille " is a thoroughly contemporary movie , the despair of which sometimes recalling such works as " Rosetta " . Actually , it recalls in its form , Julien Duvivier's work , his movies made up of sketches particularly " sous le ciel de Paris " ( 1952 ) when all the subplots came together in an almost seamless whole . And as for despair , Duvivier's movies were pessimism flesh on the bone . Guédiguian's story is more realist , more loachesque , less melodramatic maybe less storybook or lyrical too . But that does not make a great difference : Duvivier and Kenneth Loach are influences every director can be proud of . The backbone of " la ville est tranquille " ( what an euphemism ! ) is a mother's struggle with her daughter's addiction , filmed with a realism hard to match . This is an absurd fight , because she's alone - she goes as far as prostituting herself to buy drugs-and because she actually helps her daughter in her fall . But there are a lot of subplots , most of them as absorbing as the main story : sometimes they interfere with it . The taxi driver sequences , for instance , do not seem to have a lot to do with it , but after a while a strong connection appears . And before the meeting , we already know the character : a man who ' s not found a woman who's got what it takes , he's an old bachelor whose father and mother are longing to see him settled down . these parents are the only characters that have got something of Marcel Pagnol , they are definitely people of the past , not only because they are old , but because class struggle which they championed has become a thing of the past : the sequence in the taxi when the driver sings Pottier's " l'Internationale " in several languages is revealing for that matter . Mini subplots give the movie substance : a meeting with a disquieting far right leader has a strong contemporary feel : " we like the Aliens , but we do prefer the French ( of French extraction ) . Only the bourgeois couple and its sentimental - and intellectual - problems are irrelevant . spoilers spoilers spoilers " La ville est tranquille " manages to give the audience a good dose of optimism though . one of the opening shots a young boy playing the piano in order to buy one : he's an Alien too and this vision is almost surrealist . At the very end of the movie , when the audience seems to have lost any hope , a truck brings the piano to the child prodigy who begins to play . Then a crowd ( of rejected ? ) gathers and , for a while , forgets all about its burden . end of spoilersIf there had been any doubts , this movie finally and firmly placed R . Guédiguian among the greatest , most ambitious directors contemporary French cinema has produced .

Rodriguez , with his usual energy , takes us through a recipe that sounds very interesting and goes into the right amount of detail about each step . In about half the amount of time the title puts the short's running time at , he teaches us how to cook this food , and even takes some time to give a few general tips on cooking . With a mix of hand-held and static camera , this is a little different as far as cinematography goes than the two previous Ten Minute " schools " , but Rodriguez , who comes across as someone who was just about born with the camera in his hand , pulls it off perfectly , with nary a wrong shot or angle . The editing is crisp and smooth as always when Robert is in charge of it , and there is not a single boring moment found throughout . For anyone not terribly familiar with Rodriguez , know that he does occasionally swear , and does so a little in this , as well . On that same note , if such words offend you , you'd probably prefer not to look at the Memorable Quotes for this short . I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez , and anyone looking for cooking tips and / or a recipe on the Mexican food that's part of the title of this .
585371	1219578	85333	4.0	deadly vehicle round 2	From the eighties onwards , it became trendy to adapt one of the most prolific and popular American writers , Stephen King for the silver screen and the telly . I must say that I'm not a devotee of his work at all . Ditto for John Carpenter whose filmography didn't embellish the horror / fantasy genre except maybe at a pinch : " Halloween " ( 1978 ) . The tenet of a cursed vehicle that gives the ones who have the misfortune to stand in its way a hard time isn't novel . Steven Spielberg's debut movie , " Duel " ( 1971 ) revolved around the same thrust with the difference that it was an enormous truck instead of a car that tracked down Dennis Weaver and the film was gripping in its dramatic progression . Spielberg's making nearly evolved on the razor's edge and " Duel " is one of his finest cinematographic moments to date . And his movie kept a part of mystery : was there really a driver in the truck or not ? In Carpenter's flick , this zone of shadow is clarified : " Christine " is possessed by devilish forces and can drive ( and mend ) itself . Carpenter's film is nearly a rehash of Spielberg's film . Yes , technically the director keeps an attentive eye on his work and his efforts on the camera work , lighting , tightened scenery are palpable with some spooky special effects in the bargain : when the car turns on the radio to play some rock n'roll music of the fifties / sixties or mends itself , it gives goose pimples . But the film is handicapped by a weak scenario which doesn't carry much weight . Take a timid , hung-up teenager named Arnie who is the scapegoat of the riff-Raff of his high-school , make him fall in love with an old car which epitomizes an exit to a sultry familial household , change his behavior and then . . . Well what to expect ? Nearly nothing as soon as we make the acquaintance of the main characters of the film and their various relationships with Arnie and his car . The story is as linear , predictable as one could wish . Hence an absence of dramatic progression . But there's perhaps this ambiguous ( and positive ) side all the same : is Arnie really in love with " Christine " ? Isn't he rather manipulated by her ? And still this tepid music that Carpenter persists in writing . If you want a good dose of shivers with a deadly vehicle , why not doing justice to Spielberg's film ?
579654	583640	59122	10.0	Exceptional effort to maximize the limits inherent in limited animation quite successfully	This short won an Academy Award and justly so . While others have said the scripted narration is not terribly good , I disagree . There are one or two excessively florid points , but Robert Morley's marvellous reading covers those and overall , the scripted narration is good . The animation succeeds in part because of the narration . Chuck Jones and Maurice Noble have every right to be well pleased with this cartoon . Why it isn't in print , I don't understand . Highly Recommended .
436602	9938570	83972	6.0	Friday the 13th Part 3	Steve Minor turns the notch up in graphic violence and cheese stuck with the gimmicky 3D to foil any chance of a true terror in this third film ( his second ) in the Friday series regarding a fresh crop of teens ( led by Dana's Kimmel's Chris who somehow survived a presumed attack by an unmasked Jason Voorhies at one point two years previous stating she blacked out ) who get butchered in numerous ways by Jason Voorhies , who goes without a mask at the start eventually placing the hockey mask ( taken from the porcine prankster Shelly , played by Larry Zerner ) on for good . The 3D gimmick really does the film no good as watching a yo-yo come towards the screen or juggling fruit aren't that awe-inspiring . Especially goofy is when an eye-ball pops towards the screen from a victim's face as Jason crushes his skull ( it's quite obvious that a string is pulling out a fake eyeball from a facial mask ) . Probably the best gag is the harpoon sequence that darts a spear into a victim's eye ( Jason has quite the dead aim ) . There's a motorcycle gang who are about to get even when Shelly nearly runs over one of them with a car . . they make perfect fodder for Jason to destroy . You have a pitchfork protruding a man's chest , a fellow who likes to walk on his hands who is stabbed by a machete then later seen above his soon-to-be dead girlfriend sawed in two , a girl who receives a blade through her throat , one man gets his arm chopped off , another gets his throat slashed , a woman who is stabbed through the stomach by a flaming poker , etc . Paramount studios surprisingly let Minor get away with some violence on-screen this time . The ending of course has poor Chris running for her life . . this is by far the best part of the film as it mostly abandons the 3D gimmick ascending into an act of survival . Chris will be driven mad as the ending toys with her and the viewer in fine fashion even incorporating a jump scare that worked so well in the original . Interesting element is that Jason's grotesque face is shown as an adult in all it's glory leaving an impact .
438299	306861	25173	10.0	Classic Harlow Performance Is Still A Dazzler	THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York City knowing exactly what she wants : to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity . With her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon , but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love ? Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy . With her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments , she is a dazzler . But her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress . She has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the Hollywood pantheon . An excellent cast gives Harlow fine support : Lionel Barrymore as the wily old tycoon , wise to Harlow's ways ; handsome Franchot Tone as his son , smitten with love ; raucous Patsy Kelly , stealing her scenes as Harlow's sidekick ; debonair Alan Mowbray , as a well-mannered English Lord ; elderly Clara Blandick as Barrymore's feisty secretary ; hearty Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies ; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who catches Kelly's flirtatious eye ; and Lewis Stone , unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman . It should be noted that this film was produced soon after Hollywood's Production Code was instituted . A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN , made two years earlier , would be fascinating - in which Harlow's character goes after the same ends , but uses very different means .
454873	11228318	45037	8.0	Pluto's Christmas Tree is a very enjoyable Walt Disney Christmas cartoon	Just went on YouTube and rediscovered this classic cartoon from Walt Disney starring Mickey Mouse , Pluto , and Chip ' n ' Dale that I first saw on " The Wonderful World of Disney " on December 25 , 1977 when the episode was the all-animated " From All of Us to All of You " . In this one , Mickey and his dog live in a cabin near the tree that the chipmunks reside in . C ' n ' D have some mischief with the yellow dog before master Mickey chops their tree down . Since the mouse is oblivious to the little rodents , Pluto risks trouble in pursuing them . . . Directed by usual Donald Duck helmer Jack Hannah , Pluto's Christmas Tree shows nice timing in many visual gags especially of the chase variety though they do pale somewhat compared to the kinds of pacing that abound in the Warner Bros . and M-G-M cartoons of this period . Still , it's enjoyable enough and well worth seeing for Walt Disney enthusiasts of all kinds .
363835	4888011	473753	7.0	Jimi Hendrix's song comes to the screen	Ever since Luc Besson directed " The Fifth Element " , it was probably hard to imagine him directing a movie like the mystifying " Angel-A " . But he did , and the movie impressed me . One might interpret it as the same idea as Jimi Hendrix's song in which an angel - whether real or metaphorical - saves a person's existence . Certainly how Angela helps Andre fix up his life in a world that seemingly rejected him , that's a matter of interpretation . But I also detect an allusion to France's treatment of the North Africans ( but that's just conjecture , so don't quote me ) . But overall , I think that Luc Besson is offering hope amidst the turmoil that has engulfed the world . It's a little bit like " Pan's Labyrinth " in that sense . So I recommend it .
493394	3280905	34182	10.0	John Wayne's First Technicolor Film	THE SHEPHERD OF THE HILLS was made into a silent film in 1919 . Harold Bell Wright , the author of the story , was a popular novelist of the day , and a number of his stories were turned into films . He usually concentrated on stories regarding people who lived in mountainous regions ( one hesitates to call them hillbillies as they are usually shown to be non-stereotypes ) . As was mentioned in another of the comments here , Wright also wrote the story that was the basis for the Henry Fonda / Fred MacMurray film THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE . John Wayne is not the central figure of this film , although considered the star nowadays . In reality this film should be considered one of the best in the career of Harry Carey Sr . A leading movie cowboy actor in the silent period and early sound years , Carey had slowly moved into character parts after 1933 . Possibly his best recalled non-western role is the Vice President of the United States in MR . SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON . As a Western star , he proved to be Wayne's own model of the perfect western film actor . In fact , in the shooting of John Ford's THE SEARCHERS , Wayne purposely honored Carey by copying a mannerism he had ( holding his arm with his hand in a particular position ) in Wayne's last visible moment in that film . In the movie Wayne is a member of a family centered around James Barton and Beulah Bondi ( Wayne's blood aunt ) , and his cousin Marc Lawrence . Bondi has never forgiven Wayne's father for abandoning the family , and indirectly causing the death of her sister . She has instilled in Wayne a hatred of the father . At the same time , the death of the sister is tied to the other tragedy of the family - that Lawrence is a mute . He has been unable to speak since he survived the fire that killed his aunt ( Wayne ' mother ) . The only one who occasionally stands up against Bondi's vicious hatred is Barton , but he admits in his best scene in the film that he really lacks the nerve to openly condemn her behavior . This is a great film for character actors . Besides Barton , Bondi , and Lawrence , please take note of Marjorie Main in one of her most prescient performances . She is blind , and she requires expensive surgery to have a chance for the restoration of her sight . At a critical moment Carey will lend her the money for that surgery . When her eyesight is restored everyone in the community rejoices , until Main recognizes somebody in the crowd she did not expect to ever see again . Her comment when she reveals this person's identity , and realizes the tragedy she may have unwittingly caused , is devastating in it's simplicity and ironic truth . Carey is a newly arrived rancher in the area , who ( as witness his assistance to Main ) gets involved trying to do good for his neighbors . And all usually benefit . Yet he too has his secrets , and they nearly rip him and several others apart . THE SHEPHERD OF THE HILLS is a movie about redemption and forgiveness , and it's cast shows the difficulties faced by common people when presented with these seemingly simple acts of behavior . All of the stars of the movie gave first rate performances in it , and for Wayne it was the first big follow-up to his overnight success in STAGECOACH . But the best performance remains Carey's , who in the end has to commit an act of violence in order to try to save his last chance for acceptance from those who count the most .
459554	2467618	901490	9.0	It's hard to watch without becoming affected	This is a two Kleenex short film - - the sort that might make many out there cry . That's because the topic is child abuse and the film is about a boy in a coma who is on death's door after being beaten . While you see the boy lying in bed covered in bandages , you see the boy walking about the hospital with a little girl who seems to be acting as his guide . The boy can't recall exactly what has happened or why he is there and the little girl does her best to comfort him and reassure him that everything is now going to be fine . While much of the film is pretty obvious ( you'll probably quickly realize the boy in the coma is the boy wandering unseen about the hospital ) but despite this , it's an excellent film for many reasons . The use of Barber's Adagio is very effective , as this is probably one of the saddest musical pieces ever written , yet it is also soft and complements the film well . Likewise , the soft lighting and cinematography is exceptional . These combine to set an appropriately somber mood and do a lot to manipulate the viewer into an emotional reaction ( something tough to do but done well here ) . As a result , it makes a strong emotional connection with the viewer about child abuse and you can't help but be pulled into this finely crafted film .
405138	2020269	90315	10.0	Unique . Beautiful . Moving .	" When The Wind Blows " is an animated movie , adapted from the marvelous repertoire of Raymond Briggs , about an unexceptional retired couple who are about to live through a hugely exceptional event . Undoubtedly you've seen many terrific animated movies before . Most likely you've also watched many great dramas dealing with the horrible effects of ( nuclear ) warfare before . But surely you haven't seen anything like " When The Wind Blows " , as it's the most totally unique and original take on the tragic & horrific effects of war ever accomplished . You don't expect the story and the atmosphere to be disturbing , but they are ! You don't expect the animated characters to move and affect you , but they do ! And you honestly don't expect a movie like this to haunt your thoughts for so long after finishing it , but IT DOES ! Everything about this ' cartoon ' is downright astonishing ; from the peculiar & dared narrative structure ( Jim and Hilda are the only two characters ) , the constant atmosphere of overpowering menace ( the feeling of war is literally present ) , the moody soundtrack ( including David Bowie and Roger Waters ) and ? last but not least ? the detailed character drawings of the adorable protagonists . Jim and Hilda are unique in their naivety . When increasingly alarming news bulletins warn people about the outbreak of war , they obediently follow government-distributed pamphlets and ' build ' a bomb shelter out of wooden doors and bedroom pillows . The couple lives completely isolated , so they have no real idea about the horrific seriousness of the situation , but they're not really worried as long they got their security brochures , each other's company and their ( fond ) memories of the last time this happened during WWII . Even after the bomb has fallen , when Jim and Hilda appear to be the last remaining souls in England ( but physically suffering as well ) , the extremely amiable couple simply carries on preparing grocery lists and drinking tea . It's nearly impossible to accept , but these drawn and animated figures are far more moving and identifiable than real actors and actresses . Probably everyone who watches this film will recognize his / her own grandparents whilst observing Jim and Hilda . They're a bit unworldly ? aren't all elderly folks ? overly caring , friendly , calm and often downright frustratingly ignorant ! The second half of the film , when acid raid and dusty clouds tumble down , is almost unbearably saddening and emotionally devastating . The drama elements are sincere and effective and , even more importantly , they never once feel exploitative . And , in case it isn't obvious just yet , " When The Wind Blows " definitely isn't a film for young children or even overly sensitive people to watch . It's a criminally underrated and unforgettable masterpiece that courageously illustrates the unstable ambiance of the cold-war era and I can only insist admirers of true cinema to track it down .
396030	2483625	78740	3.0	If Not For The Courage Of The Fearless Crew , The Concorde Would Be Lost	The real star of the last of the Airport films is that big supersonic carrier the French created called The Concorde . If you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky , than the whole film kind of makes sense . But if you're expecting some serious drama here , than by all means take some of the evasive action the Concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down . Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon Robert Wagner . One of Wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of Wagner's dirty business dealings , selling arms to folks not friendly to the USA . When the source , Macon McCalman , is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts Wagner with the information . And of course he denies it . But right before Blakely boards The Concorde , McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire hands her the necessary documents . But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris , Wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down . But the fearless crew of Alain Delon , David Warner , and George Kennedy is up to all their tricks . It's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film . If you're an aviation enthusiast , you absolutely won't care about the plot . It's like the film Le Mans with Steve McQueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item . Maybe Le Mans is better at that because they just didn't bother with any kind of story . Among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker , a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child , played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the loo . She's actually the best one here . Robert Wagner must have been psychic though because I'm sure on the strength of this film he got the part of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series . I'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film , but it seems to have killed the Airport saga of movies .

513660	3223254	341573	6.0	Variations on the Theme of Relationships	SEX , POLITICS & COCKTAILS is another version of the 30s-something relationship avoiders trying to master the art of partner browsing , ' looking for love in all the wrong places ' . This little shoestring film seems more like a stand-up comedian gig with visuals than a movie . That may be due to the fact that the writer and director and producer and star are all one person - Julien Hernandez . While Hernandez has a charm and adequate charisma to make this theme work , his film could have benefited from outsourcing the roles other than actor and make a little movie that would have seemed more entertaining and less self indulgent . Screenwriter Sebastien ( Julien Hernandez ) has turned 30 and has yet to have a significant relationship - or employment . When a film project is offered to him , despite the fact that the subject matter is a study of gay relationships , Sebastien pleads for the job and then turns to his best friend Daria ( Marisa Petroro ) who is constantly surrounded by gay friends to introduce him to the gay life ( Sebastien has been living a straight life ) . What follows is an endless set of encounters with gay men in interviews , in acting out , and in demonstrating just what makes various gay relationships work and not work . Sebastien is drawn to the crowd as they are drawn to him and begins to feel the gravity pull towards the men , one of whom is a wealthy African American male Billy ( Lonnie Henderson ) who dispels all of Sebastien's prejudices . The characters we meet in this survey are for the most part stereotypically flat and some of the ' controversial ' parts , such as Sebastien's first encounter with a solo night of video porn and a banana fugue , go on too long to remain funny . Julien Hernandez is a talented guy on the screen with a big dollop of charisma and natural charm . The one standout actor is Marisa Petroro who has a fine screen presence and saves the film in every scene in which she is featured . The problem with SEX , POLITICS & COCKTAILS lies in the direction and the decisions to employ too many camera tricks , flashbacks , stills on moving shots , and captions that only serve to slow the film down and reveal a degree of self indulgence . Others such as Woody Allen are capable of combining all the roles that Hernandez takes on but manage to keep the resulting work focused . But then this is Hernandez first outing and despite the overall weakness of this effort , he does give notice of a man with talent : he just needs a good director ! Grady Harp
458910	2467618	72409	7.0	See " Gordon " from SESAME STREET playing a pimp ! ! ! !	This film is brought to you by the letter " P " . Kids , let's think of some words that start with " P " , . . . In probably the weirdest case of casting I can think of , Roscoe Orman plays the title character - - who is a pimp ! Years later , Orman would achieve some notoriety playing " Gordon " on SESAME STREET - - now THAT'S interesting casting ! ! Seeing this 70s " super-pimp " all decked out in furs and pimp costume is very , very surreal - - especially with the amazingly over-the-top style and language and crazy pimp-mobiles ! Now , although Willie is on top of his game , his world begins to crumble when an ex-hooker turned social worker decides that enough is enough . She encourages the prostitutes to dump this jerk and either go into business for themselves or try something legitimate . Willie responds by threatening the lady . She decides to declare war on Willie and things look really , really bad for the pimp-meister . However , when things go worst for Willie , the movie takes a very , very strange twist with the social worker - - one that rather blindsided me . While not at all believable , it was certainly an interesting twist . While this is a so-called " blaxploitation " film in many ways ( especially due to the lead being a pimp ) , the film is much different than you'd expect . First , it's story is stronger than the genre - - with some complexity . Second , the film isn't all " black and white " with cartoon-like characters and silly stereotypes . The cop who hates Willie the most is a Black cop who's a Muslim . Third , the film lacks the nudity and hard edge you'd normally see . And finally , the story doesn't seem either anti-White or glorify evil by the time it's finished - - and as such , is a much more three dimensional film that's worth a look . Needless to say , this film that , at times , glamorizes pimps may seem like the ultimate misogynistic film , but stick with it . Rabid feminists probably should not watch this film or they'll suffer a stroke , but if they'd bear with it , by the end it does have a positive message and is not a " pro-pimp " film like THE MACK ! ! !
548420	1111192	455760	7.0	Somewhat different ghost tale .	Not that it is all that original , mind you . Watching it brought to mind for me a movie called " Devil Doll " . Granted it is much better than that flick and it has a supernatural tone that I rather like as well . The main problem I had with the film is the whole innocent man gets wrongly accused aspect of the film . However , near the end this disappears so I was able to enjoy the film more . The story , man's wife is murdered , signs point to an old poem told to children in the man's home town , man investigates only to find something horrifying awaiting him . Yes , the movie is a bit of a ghost story with a twist and for the most part it works rather well . The sets are pretty good here , especially the lake theater set which reminded me of something from Silent Hill . The story moves at a fairly brisk pace , and even though I basically figured out one part of the ending I was a bit surprised at the whole end . The murders though are all basically the same every time so there really is nothing new to see each time a person dies . Still there is enough going on to keep one on their toes . The police officer character was a bit annoying at first too , but he grew on me after awhile . So what should one expect from said movie ? A lot of ventriloquist dolls , tongues , and a rather disturbing ending .

556529	1406078	43361	8.0	Blindness	" Bright Victory " came as a total surprise . The film is not seen as much as it should , because of its positive message . Mark Robson directed with an eye to detail . " Bright Victory " was adapted by Robert Bruckner and has a pleasant music score by Frank Skinner . In spite of taking place during WWII , the movie seems timeless right now because of the Iraqi conflict . We are shown an Army hospital where the young soldiers are seen rehabilitating and learning new skills for their permanent disabilities . The wounded men we see in the Army facility at Valley Forge , Pa . , are being treated because of their blindness as a result of wounds received in combat . For a 1951 film , " Bright Victory " , was light years ahead since the young G . I . s we see in the hospital have to come to terms with the fact they will not be able to see again in their lives . It's a credit to its director and screen writer to present this new reality the soldiers are going through with compassion and dignity . A great performance from Arthur Kennedy , one of the best actors of that era , makes this movie appealing . Peggy Dow , as the compassionate young woman who volunteers in entertaining the wounded soldiers , is a welcome presence in the film . Mr . Kennedy and Ms . Dow made the film even better because their no nonsense approach to the portrayal of these two souls that find one another in the worst possible circumstances . The movie also presents in smaller roles actors that went to have careers of their own . Will Geer , James Edwards , Jim Backus , Richard Egan , Murray Hamilton , Rock Hudson , and Jerry Paris play as part of the ensemble cast gathered for " Bright Victory " . This film is worth seeing because it shows us how some people overcome a terrible fate in a way we never thought possible .
398656	1391795	71629	5.0	Nothing special or memorable , but passable low-budget 1970's horror .	Elderly Pauline Christophe lives in a nice old mansion atop a mountain where , yes , there is a skull visible in the rock . She arranges for four strangers - her kin - to come to the mansion , and after she passes away , the four experience a series of strange , voodoo-related occurrences . Minor African-American themed horror movie has some atmosphere and an entertaining music score going for it . It also has some likable characters and performances . Victor French ( ' Little House on the Prairie ' , ' Highway to Heaven ' ) is an interesting lead , and the classy looking Janee Michelle definitely has some appeal . Also prominent in the cast is Mike Evans of ' All in the Family ' and ' The Jeffersons ' to provide some comic relief . The film moves along well enough although the climactic voodoo ceremony goes on a little too long . It also could have used a touch more mystery . As a 1970's era B movie , I didn't think it was too bad . It kept me interested enough , and , to be sure , one just doesn't see films like this nowadays .
568118	2721657	78740	4.0	I know him ! That's Froelich , the mechanic on the Concorde !	( Some Spoilers ) The last and by far the worst of the " Airport " movies has ace airplane mechanic and all round handyman Joe Patroni , George Kennedy , now elevated to captain of the supersonic passenger jet Concorde who together with his co-pilot the hot shot Frenchman Capt . Paul Metrand , Alain Delon , are in for the ride of their lives . It turns out that big time business man Kevin Harrison , Robert Wagner , has been selling arms to countries like North Vietnam and terrorist organizations like Black September to make big bucks regardless of what those arms would do in killing innocent and American lives , like the GI's killed by them in the Vietnam War . About to be exposed by his lover news-reporter Maggie Whelan , Susan Blakely , Harrison plans to get her killed , together with the explosive evidence that she has on her , in a staged airplane accident over the Atlantic Ocean . Try as he may Harrison just can't put the Concorde down as he has heat-seeking missiles F-15 fighter planes and even the ground crew in Paris sabotage the plane in order to blow it out of the sky it's , like in that famous watch commercial , takes a licking but just keeps on ticking . With all his efforts gone by the wayside Harrison watching on TV the happy crew and passengers , including Maggie and the damaging documents , rescued from the snows of the Bavarian Alps , where the Concorde crash landed , he puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger . The only thing that saves the movie is it's unintentional humor thats a laugh a minute and never lets up until the final credits . There's Soviet star gymnastic champion Alcia Rogov , Andrea Marcovicci , who beside having a wild and secretive affair with handsome TV personality Robert Plamer , John Davidson , gets so excited and carried away with the action on broad the plane that for a moment she completely loses her , phony as it sounded , Russian accent . There's saxophonist Boisle , Jimmy J . J . Walker , who's so stoned on pot that even if the plane crashed and was sent to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean he'd be so whacked out of his skull that Boisle wouldn't even notice that he died . There's Loretta , Martha Ray , who's so nervous of flying especially if the plane she's on is continually attacked , like an USAAF B-17 over Germany in WWII , that she spends the entire trip hiding in the planes bathroom . There's also the totally unexplained ridicules and almost comedic chase scene with airplane mechanic Froelich , Jon Cedan , at the Paris Airport . Froelich who sabotaged the Concorde all of a sudden gets the willies for no reason at all after he drops some cash , that he was paid by Harrison to do the dastardly deed , at an airport medal detection machine . Froelich mindlessly runs and runs around in circles for some ten minutes and tries to either get run over or get on the toeing plane as if he either got a sudden change of heart , and tried to stop it from taking off , or just went off his bird and flipped out because of the pressure he was under . For all the positive publicity that the supersonic jet Concorde got in the movie in how indestructible it is it's days as a passenger plane were numbered . The plane was so noisy , keeping people who lived around airports from sleeping , and expensive , costing as much as $12 , 000 . 00 for a round trip from New York to Paris or London , as well as a threat to the environment , in it's gas guzzling , that it eventually priced itself out of business . By the summer of 2003 Ol ' Beak-nose as the Concorde was affectionately known finally , after almost 20 years in operation , went the way of the flying dinosaurs that it so much resembled and became like they did , some 100 million years ago , totally extinct .
579911	583640	30201	8.0	Good , but not great , short about Father Damian	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a look at the true story of a Belgian priest who went to tend to lepers in Hawaii and contracted the disease himself . At least one film has been made about Father Damien and it's a fascinating story . Thi short is good , if a bit melodramatic at times and the narration is sometimes a bit droning . Turner Classic Movies runs this between movies regularly and almost invariably runs it in March as part of their " 31 Days of Oscar " feature . Worth watching .
483831	1416505	133046	5.0	Not enough happening in this movie .	I remember when this movie first trailers came around . It looked like a fun movie but above all also a fast paced one with lots of action and thriller elements . However very little of this can be seen back into this movie . A really wasted opportunity , for it's premise was a good one and a rather interestingly original one as well . Maybe I expected too much , since Kevin Williamson , the man behind the Scream movies was at the helm of this movie . The movie turned out to be not quite good or tense enough for a thriller and too serious and weak for a fun comedy . Therefor I can't help regarding " Teaching Mrs . Tingle " as a failed movie , that misses its target . They could had done so much interesting with this movie its story but basically rarely anything tense or remarkable occurs . Mrs . Tingle spends about three quarters of the movie lying tied on bed . They could have let here character manipulate all of the students in a slick and bitchy way , to set them up against each other . The movie does this but it really doesn't go far enough in this . The movie remains pretty shallow because of this and it lacks some good tension and creativity . Not that it's boring but it isn't terrible interesting either . It's also a waste of Helen Mirren's talent . This is not a role we see her often in . She does provide the movie with some really excellent moments but the script offers her little really interesting to do . Nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either really . Katie Holmes really isn't bad in it and so isn't Barry Watson , who I think they tried to launch as the new Johnny Depp , who also started his career in a movie with a similar style as this one ; " A Nightmare on Elm Street " but he never made it and he already is a forgotten actor . Jeffrey Tambor plays a fun role and so does Molly Ringwald , who's role is obviously referring to her image of queen of high-school movies . The movie could had really used some more pace , action and tension . It now instead is a rather shallow movie in which too little ( interesting ) is happening . It still is a somewhat fun movie to watch and obviously not one to take very serious but it all isn't quite enough to make this movie stand out .
420840	2542703	467406	8.0	Juno Really Heats Up	A really inspiring film despite the usual subject matter of an unwanted teen pregnancy . Ellen Page really gives a lot of herself in her Oscar nominated performance as a teenager in trouble . Fortunately , this girl has her head on her shoulders . She knows that she can't keep the child and is able to find what she thinks will be the ideal couple to adopt her baby . Unfortunately , the couple proves not to be what we're all expecting . It seems that Page has entered their lives just at a time when their very marriage is disintegrating rapidly . Ellen's father and step-mother play an understanding couple in this situation . I was a little perplexed regarding the stepmother part of Allison Janney . When hearing the news of Page's pregnancy , she begins to exhibit religious fanaticism that we saw her do so well on a comedy level in " Hairspray . " Suddenly , she falls into line and gives a truly compelling supporting performance . This is a lovely , emotionally paced film .
548413	1111192	469683	1.0	Like Return of the Living Dead . . . IF IT SUCKED ! ! !	This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen . What gets me is that is ranks a 4 . 2 here at IMDb , the place that is extremely hard on horror movies . How is it ranked so high ? I love horror movies , but never before have I considered stopping a movie in the middle of it as I have with this one . However , I persevered and was rewarded with more crap . The acting is horrible , I have never before wanted people dead in my life and I am not talking about the characters . . . I am speaking of the actual actors . Even the zombies were horrible in this one . The only reason this one must be ranked high is the gore , which is good , but even with that I could not rank this movie any higher . The plot , losers go to bar , other more popular losers go to house in the middle of nowhere , zombies go on the attack , general running here and there and then wham movie ends in the most stupid fashion ever . During which time we have the lead guy trying to save his girlfriend , and this lead guy is the most annoying dip in the film and his scream is very annoying as well . I so wanted him to die , but he just kept going . We have a scene where the streets were empty and our three " heros " are just looking , the next thing you know there are zombies all around them to the point they can not make it to their car two feet to the left . You have a girl that gets into a convertible and seems to relax like she is safe . You also have worse production values and worse acting than found in most porn films , and you do not even get to see a boob or two in this film . All you really get to see is a bunch of people covered in blood screaming with a few good gore effects here and there . I knew this movie was going to be trouble when we were introduced to the actors while incredibly bad music played . By the way what was up with the super zombies anyway , they can rip a jaw off a girl , but can't get into a bar block off with a chair ? To much bad stuff , just to much . . . must seek out filmmakers , make it so sequel can not be made .
525321	4445210	985709	9.0	Informative & Interesting For All Beer Lovers	This program did a nice job giving the history of beer here in America . You get some good time-lines regarding the who and when of the growth , decline and then growth again of this very popular beverage . I was amazed to find out that in the days before the Mayflower dropped off the first Americans on this soil , beer had been considered than water in Europe . That's because in the process of making it and boiling it , it boiled off the impurities . The Europeans didn't figure out that the same should have been done to water , and people by routinely get sick drinking the H2O . Thus , the Pilgrams brought over barrels of the stuff and women , kids , etc . , drank it morning , noon and night . Anyway , the program explains a little bit what ingredients go into beer and how it's made , not going overboard to where it gets boring . We also learn about who started brewing it here in America , and how someone figured out how to keep it cold so it could be transported to other places . Eventually we wind up in Milwaukee and learn all about the big three Miller's , Pabst and Schlitz . Then history takes us to St . Louis and we hear the story of Adolphus Busch and the growth of the biggest brewery of them all : Anheuser-Busch ( Budweiser et al . ) We learn about the invention of bottled beer , how WWI and then Prohibition affected the business , and then how beer in cans and great advertising brought it back to prominence . From there we learn about " lite beer " and eventually micro-breweries . . . . . all aspects of the history and business of this beverage , which is today the most popular in the world . This was a very informative and fast-moving program .
418406	1609079	249655	6.0	sideways Orient-ation	I viewed a print of this short movie courtesy of Lobster Films , Paris . Here we have a French ' trick ' film by the Pathe Brothers , from the same period in which Georges Melies was making his very popular trick movies . However , in Melies's films the trickery was accomplished by jump cuts , and spectacle was provided by elaborate sets and audacious story lines . In ' The Kiriki , Japanese Acrobats ' , we have a fairly straightforward acrobatic performance , abetted by some trickery that is far simpler than Melies's box of tricks , yet no less satisfying . We see some men , women and children in gymnastic clothing , clearly Caucasian yet made up to look vaguely Oriental , with ridiculously built-up foreheads covered by ludicrous hairstyles . The women creep back and forth in that ridiculous shuffling gait ( move the feet very quickly but in very tiny steps ) that western performers affect to simulate Orientals . I realise that , in the first decade of the twentieth century , the most proficient acrobatic troupes were nearly all Japanese . . . but frankly , this ying-tong Japanoiserie did absolutely nothing to add to the proceedings , and should have been dispensed with . In small groups , the troupe rapidly execute a series of acrobatic manoeuvres which are so dazzling that they seem nearly superhuman . There is , of course , a trick : a deceptively simple one , yet done so skilfully that some viewers may have difficulty figuring it out . TRICK EXPLAINED NOW . Except for some ' book-end ' footage at the beginning and the end , which is shot conventionally , the entire movie is filmed with an overhead camera shooting STRAIGHT DOWN onto a black velvet dropcloth surrounded by four upright walls . The actors , lying on this surface , affect postures to indicate that they are standing upright , with one of the walls being treated as a horizontal floor . When the tumblers move ' upwards ' , supposedly defying gravity , they are in fact merely moving horizontally , away from the wall representing the ' floor ' and towards the opposite wall representing the ' ceiling ' . The lighting , from directly above , eliminates side shadows and makes the trickery less obvious . The trick is made more difficult to spot because the stunts are done quickly and proficiently , and the performers demonstrate some genuine agility . To call this a ' trick ' film is slightly demeaning to their efforts , since there is some genuine acrobatic work going on here : just not in the direction that it seems to be . I was amused and impressed by this movie , but I would have enjoyed it far more without the utterly unnecessary racial stereotyping . My rating for this one : .
408952	2567136	450664	9.0	Blanc Check	Yet another French actress has turned , via screen writing , to directing and turned out a minor gem first crack out of the box . Inasmuch as it's set on a farm and involves an older man and a young woman it is reminiscent of The Girl From Paris - and that's not a criticism ; Mathilde Seigner and Michel Serrault were both excellent - and shows that it is possible to put a spin on this type of story . Michel Blanc farms what seems a touch too many acres for someone working with only a wife and a simple hired hand . Within minutes his wife expires off screen via the electric milking machine leaving Blanc with no one to cook , sew , scrub , do the milking etc so he takes the Dating Agency route and winds up in Bucharest interviewing lots of gorgeous young girls who have all mastered the same mantra ' you're so handsome ' . Only one girl , the lovely Medeea Marinescu ( who actually hails from Bucharest ) has the wit to effect an interest in farming and winds up his best of a bad bunch mate of choice . We've been here before , of course , notably in Rachel And The Stranger , when it took stranger Robert Mitchum to make William Holden see Loretta Young as something else besides a mail-order bride , but this is none the worse for that . This is all about relationships and how difficult they are to both establish and maintain and how people CAN change the habits of a lifetime - a sequence where Blanc , who doesn't like parting with a buck , lays a few thousand euros on Elena and tells her she's cracked the lottery would normally want some swallowing but here we're more than happy to accept it . Two exceptional leads , a low-key story with just the right amount of sentiment ; highly recommended .
403289	453228	107808	7.0	Cosner could not ruin this film	Cosner's films usually stink , but with the right script he acts exceptionally well . This Eastwood movie is a solid ; with Eastwood playing his usual character role . A Perfect World title is a irony , for life is not black and white but grey . In the end , this film gets that message across .
484581	1416505	86856	5.0	Odd title , odd movie .	Not too sure what to think about this movie . It seems like its a spoof , of what , I do not know however . Perhaps of comic-book type of movies from the ' 80's , or adventurous serials from the ' 30's / 40's ? But then again there's the problem that the movie is not really funny and on top of that , also not so very well made . Guess the movie can best be seen as a cult-classic , for the fans of it . To be honest , the movie began well and promising . It developed some potentially interesting characters and plot lines but for some reason as the movie progresses they don't get handled well . The movie becomes more crazy and crazy as the movie heads toward the ending . At one point I even stopped caring and wanting to understand what the movie was all about . It was confusing , it was poor but above all it was odd . The movie could had been fun , the movie could had been action filled but yet it all isn't . It's wasted potential , cause I guess that in essence Buckaroo Banzai isn't really a bad fun movie main-hero . The movie is only fun now really with its character's names . All of the alien's their first name is John and they have names such as John Bigboote , John O'Connor and John Smallberries . But other than that , there isn't really much fun present in the movie . The many famous actors however still provide the movie with some fun and this uplifts the movie . Amazing how many great actors are in this movie such as Ellen Barkin , Jeff Goldblum , Christopher Lloyd , Clancy Brown , Ronald Lacey , Vincent Schiavelli and Dan Hedaya . John Lithgow is deliciously overacting as the movie its main villain but I just wish that he had more sequences and was made more interesting as a character . Peter Weller was a great leading man in the ' 80's and he shows with this movie how well he can carry a movie . The special effects are all decent for ' 80's standards but perhaps overused a bit too much . The musical score is typically ' 80's like and absolutely horrible . Further more the movie is fairly well looking , too bad inexperienced director W . D . Richter doesn't know how to use everything to its full potential . Yet it's not all that bad and the movie still entertains , so the movie obviously still has some redeeming qualities which makes this still a bit of a watchable movie .
520125	1162550	117318	6.0	Horridly white-washed , yet entertaining just the same	Well acted , but horribly white washed tale of Larry Flint ( Woody ' Boyd ' Harrelson ) finding his fourth wife , Athena ( Courtney Love ) , starting his Hustle enterprise , being shot ( sometimes bad things happen to bad people ) , and his subsequent Supreme Court case brought about in part by Jerry Falwell ( another evil man ) . By painting Larry in such broad flattering strokes as to make him practically into a saint of the First Amendment right and a fabled crusader of free speech and the American way . In doing this in such a horribly one-sided way , Milos Forman doesn't do the film any favors . I hesitate to even call it a Biopic for it's so lopsided . That said , and if one just watches it for entertainment value ALONE , than the film succeeds greatly . Just remember that ANYthing even remotely connected to Oliver Stone is going to be completely factual and great liberties will be taken . Special Edition DVD Extras : Commentary by screenwriters Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski ; Second commentary by actors Woody Harrelson , Courtney Love & Edward Norton 2 featurettes ( : Free Speech or Porn ? , & Larry Flynt Exposed ) ; 2 deleted scenes with optional commentary ; New York Times review ; Filmographies ; Theatrical trailer ; and trailers for " Charlie's Angels : Full Throttle " and " Auto Focus " 6 Easter Eggs : In the Audio set up menu highlight a hidden campaign button on James Carville's suit for a vintage campaign ad from Flint ; In the subtitles menu there's a second vintage campaign ad ; a third one in Courtney Love's filmography page ; yet another in the main menu , STILL yet another in the special features menu ; and In Woody Harrelson's Filmography page there's one egg that doesn't have to do with Flynt's campaign thankfully
548321	1111192	258979	8.0	A fun Spidey game on the Playstation .	This game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics . Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor . The city is being overrun by a strange gas , and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city . Who is behind these crimes ? Could it be Doc Ock ? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf . Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity . Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery . The fighting is basic , not to hard to pick up , the fights with the bosses are rather fun . You get to collect comics , you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city . However , that is also a weak point . The swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky . You also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game . Still , it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story . So be prepared to see Scorpion , Rhino , Venom , Mysterio , Doctor Octopus , and Carnage for one wild action packed ride .
458684	2467618	1128210	7.0	Decent , but the end practically made me cry	This short film is about an honors student who is taken out of school for the day because his family can't pay their rent and he's trying to hire himself out for undocumented day labor . During the course of this kid's day , you see his fellow students at school talking about the situation with illegal aliens in America today . I am a school teacher in Florida - - a state known for its high Hispanic population , so this short film hit home . By far the largest minority in my school is Hispanic and I have known my high schoolers to be taken out of school or arrive late due to their needing to work for the family business or take care of kids while their parents to manual labor . This film reminded me of several of these kids and how tough it is for their families to make ends meet . In addition , the very end of the film really made me think - - and practically made me cry . In fact , the ending really made the film , as the student discussion was only okay - - but the chance meeting really hit home . Well made and interesting - - I hope to see more from these film makers .
407015	865972	53719	8.0	Very atmospheric .	John Llewelyn Moxey's " The City of the Dead " is a wonderfully atmospheric and sinister witchcraft tale . There is a distinct air of dread over the entire film and the sets are all appropriately fog enshrouded . The acting is pretty good and the score is really nice . A young student Nan Barlow ( Venetia Stevenson ) goes to an old town called Whitewood that is recommended by her creepy professor , Alan Driscoll ( Christopher Lee ) . The town was the site where the famous witch Elizabeth Selwyn ( Patricia Jessel ) was burned at the stake almost one hundred years ago , and Nan thinks its a perfect place to do her research . Where Nan's family and boyfriend don't hear from her in almost two weeks , they organize a search that ends up revealing the truth about town and its mysterious residents .
366571	3109237	28709	7.0	Big Time Spoiler Alert	Charlie Chan and # 1 son Lee get mixed up with a mysterious woman on board a ship bound for New York . Unbeknownst to Chan , the woman is the former girlfriend of a gangster with information that , if published , could blow the lid off the underworld . She hides a small package in Chan's luggage to make sure it gets to New York safely . Shortly after arriving in New York , the woman is murdered in an office at the Hottentot Club . Can Chan discover the woman's secret and find her killer ? Charlie Chan on Broadway is yet another very solid entry in the Chan series . Warner Oland and Keye Luke are as good and entertaining as ever . Plus , anytime I see the names Marc Lawrence or Leon Ames in the credits , I know I'm in for a good time . But the highlight of this one has to be the killer's identity . It completely caught me off guard . BIG TIME SPOILERS ? If you've seen enough of the Charlie Chan movies ( or any other detective type movies from the 30s and 40s ) , there are a few absolutes you can generally count on . One of them is that the Chan movies usually feature a young couple in love . While both may come under suspicion at some point in the movie , they are always exonerated by the end to continue their dreamy relationship . That's not the case in Charlie Chan on Broadway . One of the last people I expected ? the male half of the ideal couple ? is found to be the killer . It really threw me for a loop ! END OF BIG TIME SPOILERS Overall , I'm very pleased to have discovered a " new " Charlie Chan film . I look forward to revisiting it many times in the future .
527143	4445210	104940	8.0	My Favorite Version Of This Famous Story	In terms of humor or songs , I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film . The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic : very Christian-like and very profound . Scrooge ( Michael Caine ) , meanwhile , is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions . His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring , generous person is done more subtly , too , than in other films . However , to be fair , sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story . The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing . Not much offensive in here , either , making this a good film for little ones as well as older , sentimental folks .
